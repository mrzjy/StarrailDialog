In fact, he joined the Express Crew to escape from a past of his own making.\\nBut can the Express really help him outrun his past?", "2": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nIt's just another extremely average day aboard this giant ship. The markets have just opened and the morning dew is still fresh, but the young man crossing the street has never seen such a sight. Before he manages to notice all the differences between the actual city and its descriptions in books, he is immersed in savoring the warmth of the sun on the back of his neck.\\n\\nIt is his first time seeing his own body clearly. This body belongs to him. It belongs to this current name.\\n\\nWhen he arrives at the port, the escorting soldier removes the last of his shackles. He walks forward without looking back. He can feel, ever so faintly, several pairs of eyes gazing at him from within the city. Eyes filled with hatred.\\n\\nIt isn't until the spaceship takes off that he turns his head and takes one final look at this place. It really is a magnificent and grand spaceship — just like the books say.\\n\\nHe only glances at it once, then turns his head away to where the stars shimmer dimly and an uncertain future lies.\\n\\nHe looks out in silence.", "3": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nHe steps off one IPC spaceship, then boards another. He'd never even heard of the ship's destination, but that doesn't matter. There is nowhere he particularly wanted to go.

None of the IPC crews care who he is, so long as he can work.\\n\\nHe has changed his appearance and might no longer be recognized, but he knows that same power still lurks within him, unable to be shaken off no matter where he goes. This power drags him down, slows him, tries to overwhelm him, and makes him unable to escape his past. He has to be careful.\\n\\nBut he still can't shake off the man with the beastly eyes.\\n\\nIf others in his homeworld felt hatred toward him, then that man only has a killing intent toward him — even the spaceships he had traveled on were all annihilated. That man had died before him, but would reappear soon after.\\n\\nOutside his homeworld, there's a larger world where anything is possible.", "4": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nHe boards another spaceship, and the passengers are all wearing different masks. He nearly has his memory stolen, and is forced to listen to a lecture that sounded like mad ramblings.\\n\\nHe knows that huge monsters prowl upon this route, but he could only find a way toward survival by traveling along the most dangerous of roads.\\n\\nHe defeats the huge monsters and disembarks at the next port. He thinks he could remain undetected among the countless ships, but he is stopped by a redhead woman. She salutes him in thanks, saying she is with one of the ships he had rescued.\\n\\nHe is about to turn and leave when he sees a parked train beside the redhead woman.\\n\\n\"Where's your next stop?\"\\n\"...Haven't decided yet.\"\\n\"Then would you like to board our Express?\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"We're retracing our previous journey.

He considers himself as only staying temporarily and refused the room specially prepared for him, making a simple bed on the floor of the Archives. However, he stayed up all night reading the data bank. At some point, he'd drifted off to sleep.\\n\\nHe opened the door to find the conductor standing there, reprimanding him for staying up late — Otherwise he'd miss out on a piping hot breakfast and would've wasted the care put into it. He nods and the conductor quietens down in satisfaction, wobbling as they lead him into the passenger car.\\n\\nThe redhead woman — who he now knows is named Himeko — flashes him a smile. The brunet man to the other side — Mr. Yang — remains silent despite appearing to have many questions on his mind.\\n\\nBefore he knew it, he'd spent many a morning just like this.\\n\\nThe process of re-visiting the route is not easy, mostly due to the numerous roadblocks caused by Stellaron. Sometimes, they would encounter the huge monsters he'd defeated before. They even found an enormous chunk of floating ice — encased in which was a living girl.\\n\\nThat's why he wasn't very surprised when he detected that the {M#boy}{F#girl} named {NICKNAME} has an actual Stellaron sealed inside {M#his}{F#her} body.\\n\\nThe Express's journey will continue on.

On her journey to trailblaze new worlds, she would need many more companions...\\nAnd while they may have different destinations, they all gaze at the same starry sky.", "2": "The girl is lost.\\n\\nShe can't remember when she became lost. She just walked and walked, on and on into the dark night, chasing the sun and the moon, over and over again — until she falls.\\n\\nShe remembers what she looked like as a college freshman, remembers her chosen major — interstellar travel dynamics — and now she's lying face down in the mud.\\n\\nShe looks up to the stars, and just then sees meteors streaming down: one, two, three... And then more, smaller ones, flickering and flashing ever so finely before a magnificent blaze tore open the night.\\n\\nHer limbs drag her forward, leading her on to where the land meets the ocean. At the shoreline, the waters jostle against her like how the tide treats that stranded Express, alone and lost.\\n\\nShe walks in and see the scenery outside beginning to change. The Express shows her a myriad of magnificent worlds. They are faraway, beyond her homeworld, yet also close enough to be a simple train ride.\\n\\nShe tries to repair the Express. It starts up only briefly, but it is enough to skid across the sky of her home. She immediately sees the path home. From that altitude, the journey is so short, and even the ocean of her homeworld appears so insignificant.\\n\\nIt asked her whether she'd like to travel together. She wonders what kind of journey that would be.\\n\\n\"A journey to the beginning.\"\\n\"Let's go then.\" Without hesitation, the girl replied, \"Just as you brought me home, so would I take you home, too.\"", "3": "Himeko has a suitcase.\\n\\nThis suitcase is her treasure trove. Previously, she'd filled it with all kinds of train repair tools to fix up the Express. But now, it's packed with a molecular saw, an escaped satellite, and countless other contraptions — the embodiment of her whims and the proof of her resolute will.\\n\\nNo travel companion is more faithful to her than this suitcase. Passengers come and go on the Express, and perhaps not even \"the conductor\" would be able to accompany her and the Express from start to finish.\\n\\nBut she doesn't care. She didn't care when that pretentious blond man left without saying goodbye, just like how she didn't care about her distant homeworld and old friends.\\n\\nShe knows that this journey is lonely. Even if she could get to know like-minded travel companions, even if they showed her generous grace, even if she could witness the end of a complete journey with those companions — that's all just a momentary fluke.\\n\\nShe knows that this journey is lonely. Nobody can follow in the exact same footsteps as anyone else. Nobody can experience for someone else everything that happens along a journey. All she can rely on are her own two eyes and feet.\\n\\nThat's why she stores inside her suitcase all the sights her eyes have witnessed, and all the footprints her feet have left behind.", "4": "Himeko's memory is very good.\\n\\nThe longer the journey gets, the more travel companions she accrues. She can still remember many of them.\\n\\nShe remembers her awkward chit-chats with Pom-Pom, and how the first two passengers aboard the Express were Welt and his blond friend. She remembers how the taciturn Dan Heng defeated the monsters that can swallow stars with just one strike of his lance. She remembers how March 7th had awoken from her icy slumber, all the outfits she'd designed for March, and what March loves the most. She remembers how the Crew arrived at Herta Space Station, how she met {NICKNAME}, and how they'd embarked on a new journey once more.\\n\\nShe remembers the specifications for every single component of the Express and how they're assembled. She remembers when to oil the Express's bearings and when each plant on the Express needs watering. She remembers Pom-Pom's non-negotiable bottom line, and that Welt has rather juvenile hobbies. She remembers that Dan Heng is always pulling all-nighters to organize the data bank, and how March 7th loves to sleep in. She remembers the personality, habits, hobbies, birthdays, and other anniversary days of everyone aboard the Express. And she remembers much, much more.\\n\\nThe greatest pleasure for Himeko is that everyone can safely reach their destination on the Express.\\n\\n\"Traveling always has an end point. When it happens, I'll smile and say goodbye to everyone.\"\\n\\nShe always says that, and she'll definitely remember to do that.\\n\\nIt's memory that has formed the road she came from, and memory that will eventually return her to the seas from whence she came.", "5": "\"What a long journey.\" She says.\\n\\n\"I've been waiting for so, so long.\"████ looks at her: \"It wasn't bad luck that has led you down this path, but wanderlust and curiosity.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" she smiles, \"But I've experienced far less than what you've been through.\"\\n\\n\"No, I've never experienced the things you have.\" ████ shakes their head: \"There are as many routes as there are pairs of feet.\"\\n\\n\"Right now, we may be standing in the same place, but we harbor different thoughts and views.\"\\n\\nTogether, they look up to the stars in silence, and just then saw meteors streaming down: one, two, three... And then more, smaller ones, flickering and flashing ever so finely before a magnificent blaze tore open the night.\\n\\nA quiet voice disturbs the still air once more: \"What do you see?\"\\n\\n\"The stars have finished their journey.\" She says.\\n\\n████ laughs: \"I, instead, see that their journey is only just beginning.\"\\n\\nThey do not speak again.\\n\\n\"Let's go back. They're waiting for me.\"\\n\\n████ is silent, then asks: \"Has the journey so far made you happy?\"\\n\\nShe picks up her suitcase and walks back in the direction of the Express without looking
