He acts as the Express' guard on its long trailblazing expedition.\\nDan Heng never talks much about his past. In fact, he joined the Express Crew to escape from a past of his own making.\\nBut can the Express really help him outrun his past?", "2": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nIt's just another extremely average day aboard this giant ship. The markets have just opened and the morning dew is still fresh, but the young man crossing the street has never seen such a sight. Before he manages to notice all the differences between the actual city and its descriptions in books, he is immersed in savoring the warmth of the sun on the back of his neck.\\n\\nIt is his first time seeing his own body clearly. This body belongs to him. It belongs to this current name.\\n\\nWhen he arrives at the port, the escorting soldier removes the last of his shackles. He walks forward without looking back. He can feel, ever so faintly, several pairs of eyes gazing at him from within the city. Eyes filled with hatred.\\n\\nIt isn't until the spaceship takes off that he turns his head and takes one final look at this place. It really is a magnificent and grand spaceship — just like the books say.\\n\\nHe only glances at it once, then turns his head away to where the stars shimmer dimly and an uncertain future lies.\\n\\nHe looks out in silence.", "3": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nHe steps off one IPC spaceship, then boards another. He'd never even heard of the ship's destination, but that doesn't matter. There is nowhere he particularly wanted to go. His only goal is to get as far away as possible from his past, from his \"home.\"\\n\\nOn these spaceships, people come and go all the time. None of the IPC crews care who he is, so long as he can work.\\n\\nHe has changed his appearance and might no longer be recognized, but he knows that same power still lurks within him, unable to be shaken off no matter where he goes. This power drags him down, slows him, tries to overwhelm him, and makes him unable to escape his past. He has to be careful.\\n\\nBut he still can't shake off the man with the beastly eyes.\\n\\nIf others in his homeworld felt hatred toward him, then that man only has a killing intent toward him — even the spaceships he had traveled on were all annihilated. That man had died before him, but would reappear soon after.\\n\\nOutside his homeworld, there's a larger world where anything is possible.", "4": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nHe boards another spaceship, and the passengers are all wearing different masks. He nearly has his memory stolen, and is forced to listen to a lecture that sounded like mad ramblings.\\n\\nHe knows that huge monsters prowl upon this route, but he could only find a way toward survival by traveling along the most dangerous of roads.\\n\\nHe defeats the huge monsters and disembarks at the next port. He thinks he could remain undetected among the countless ships, but he is stopped by a redhead woman. She salutes him in thanks, saying she is with one of the ships he had rescued.\\n\\nHe is about to turn and leave when he sees a parked train beside the redhead woman.\\n\\n\"Where's your next stop?\"\\n\"...Haven't decided yet.\"\\n\"Then would you like to board our Express?\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"We're retracing our previous journey. There's so much to see all over again. We need a guard... And an archiver.\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"You can get off any time once you made up your mind on where to go.\"\\n\"Alright.\"", "5": "A new dawn begins.\\n\\nHe rubs his eyes, realizing it had been too long since he had such a good night's sleep. He considers himself as only staying temporarily and refused the room specially prepared for him, making a simple bed on the floor of the Archives. However, he stayed up all night reading the data bank. At some point, he'd drifted off to sleep.\\n\\nHe opened the door to find the conductor standing there, reprimanding him for staying up late — Otherwise he'd miss out on a piping hot breakfast and would've wasted the care put into it. He nods and the conductor quietens down in satisfaction, wobbling as they lead him into the passenger car.\\n\\nThe redhead woman — who he now knows is named Himeko — flashes him a smile. The brunet man to the other side — Mr. Yang — remains silent despite appearing to have many questions on his mind.\\n\\nBefore he knew it, he'd spent many a morning just like this.\\n\\nThe process of re-visiting the route is not easy, mostly due to the numerous roadblocks caused by Stellaron. Sometimes, they would encounter the huge monsters he'd defeated before. They even found an enormous chunk of floating ice — encased in which was a living girl.\\n\\nThat's why he wasn't very surprised when he detected that the {M#boy}{F#girl} named {NICKNAME} has an actual Stellaron sealed inside {M#his}{F#her} body.\\n\\nThe Express' journey will continue on.

On her journey to trailblaze new worlds, she would need many more companions...\\nAnd while they may have different destinations, they all gaze at the same starry sky.", "2": "The girl is lost.\\n\\nShe can't remember when she became lost. She just walked and walked, on and on into the dark night, chasing the sun and the moon, over and over again — until she falls.\\n\\nShe remembers what she looked like as a college freshman, remembers her chosen major — interstellar travel dynamics — and now she's lying face down in the mud.\\n\\nShe looks up to the stars, and just then sees meteors streaming down: one, two, three... And then more, smaller ones, flickering and flashing ever so finely before a magnificent blaze tore open the night.\\n\\nHer limbs drag her forward, leading her on to where the land meets the ocean. At the shoreline, the waters jostle against her like how the tide treats that stranded Express, alone and lost.\\n\\nShe walks in and see the scenery outside beginning to change. The Express shows her a myriad of magnificent worlds. They are faraway, beyond her homeworld, yet also close enough to be a simple train ride.\\n\\nShe tries to repair the Express. It starts up only briefly, but it is enough to skid across the sky of her home. She immediately sees the path home. From that altitude, the journey is so short, and even the ocean of her homeworld appears so insignificant.\\n\\nIt asked her whether she'd like to travel together. She wonders what kind of journey that would be.\\n\\n\"A journey to the beginning.\"\\n\"Let's go then.\" Without hesitation, the girl replied, \"Just as you brought me home, so would I take you home, too.\"", "3": "Himeko has a suitcase.\\n\\nThis suitcase is her treasure trove. Previously, she'd filled it with all kinds of train repair tools to fix up the Express. But now, it's packed with a molecular saw, an escaped satellite, and countless other contraptions — the embodiment of her whims and the proof of her resolute will.\\n\\nNo travel companion is more faithful to her than this suitcase. Passengers come and go on the Express, and perhaps not even \"the conductor\" would be able to accompany her and the Express from start to finish.\\n\\nBut she doesn't care. She didn't care when that pretentious blond man left without saying goodbye, just like how she didn't care about her distant homeworld and old friends.\\n\\nShe knows that this journey is lonely. Even if she could get to know like-minded travel companions, even if they showed her generous grace, even if she could witness the end of a complete journey with those companions — that's all just a momentary fluke.\\n\\nShe knows that this journey is lonely. Nobody can follow in the exact same footsteps as anyone else. Nobody can experience for someone else everything that happens along a journey. All she can rely on are her own two eyes and feet.\\n\\nThat's why she stores inside her suitcase all the sights her eyes have witnessed, and all the footprints her feet have left behind.", "4": "Himeko's memory is very good.\\n\\nThe longer the journey gets, the more travel companions she accrues. She can still remember many of them.\\n\\nShe remembers her awkward chit-chats with Pom-Pom, and how the first two passengers aboard the Express were Welt and his blond friend. She remembers how the taciturn Dan Heng defeated the monsters that can swallow stars with just one strike of his lance. She remembers how March 7th had awoken from her icy slumber, all the outfits she'd designed for March, and what March loves the most. She remembers how the Crew arrived at Herta Space Station, how she met {NICKNAME}, and how they'd embarked on a new journey once more.\\n\\nShe remembers the specifications for every single component of the Express and how they're assembled. She remembers when to oil the Express' bearings and when each plant on the Express needs watering. She remembers Pom-Pom's non-negotiable bottom line, and that Welt has rather juvenile hobbies. She remembers that Dan Heng is always pulling all-nighters to organize the data bank, and how March 7th loves to sleep in. She remembers the personality, habits, hobbies, birthdays, and other anniversary days of everyone aboard the Express. And she remembers much, much more.\\n\\nThe greatest pleasure for Himeko is that everyone can safely reach their destination on the Express.\\n\\n\"Traveling always has an end point. When it happens, I'll smile and say goodbye to everyone.\"\\n\\nShe always says that, and she'll definitely remember to do that.\\n\\nIt's memory that has formed the road she came from, and memory that will eventually return her to the seas from whence she came.", "5": "\"What a long journey.\" She says.\\n\\n\"I've been waiting for so, so long.\"████ looks at her: \"It wasn't bad luck that has led you down this path, but wanderlust and curiosity.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" she smiles, \"But I've experienced far less than what you've been through.\"\\n\\n\"No, I've never experienced the things you have.\" ████ shakes their head: \"There are as many routes as there are pairs of feet.\"\\n\\n\"Right now, we may be standing in the same place, but we harbor different thoughts and views.\"\\n\\nTogether, they look up to the stars in silence, and just then saw meteors streaming down: one, two, three... And then more, smaller ones, flickering and flashing ever so finely before a magnificent blaze tore open the night.\\n\\nA quiet voice disturbs the still air once more: \"What do you see?\"\\n\\n\"The stars have finished their journey.\" She says.\\n\\n████ laughs: \"I, instead, see that their journey is only just beginning.\"\\n\\nThey do not speak again.\\n\\n\"Let's go back. They're waiting for me.\"\\n\\n████ is silent, then asks: \"Has the journey so far made you happy?\"\\n\\nShe picks up her suitcase and walks back in the direction of the Express without looking back.\\n\\n\"Same as always.\""}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Sawblade Tuning", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Fire DMG equal to 50% of

She is the Lead Researcher of the space station Herta.\\nWhether it is managing opinionated staff, or courteously but firmly responding to the Intelligentsia Guild's devious demands, Asta handles it all effortlessly.\\nAfter all... commanding a space station is much easier than taking over the family business!", "2": "Back when she was still a child but was already picking out her own telescopes, Asta would always hear the faint murmurings of elders praising her. She was quite proud of this, because she could discern the quality of a telescope's primary mirror and autoguider with a mere glance.\\n\\nIt wasn't until she drew within earshot one day that she learned they were actually tutting and tsking at her — how could such a little girl manage to pick out such expensive items?\\n\\nPersonal hobbies don't exist in the eyes of these people. All they chose to see is a pampered little princess.\\n\\n\"You like stars? Oh, I get it. You're a little girl. You all like sparkly things.\"\\n\"Yes... I'm researching protostars at the moment. I hope to name the stars I discover after myself... Just like those famous astronomers of old.\"\\n\"Is that all? Shall we name this planet after you for your next birthday? How about two planets? Those are actually quite cheap.\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"Hey, where are you going, Asta? Asta!!!\"", "3": "She knows that it doesn't matter whether she and her mother are reliable volunteers. People just want to see them here. That's all.\\n\\nAfter apportioning the food, the people disperse one by one, leaving behind a little boy. His right hand is wounded, and his eyes are like that of a wolf as he stares at her in a way she doesn't like.\\n\\n\"Are you going to ask me to borrow money?\"\\n\"I don't want any money. I have to pay back the cost of this meal, but I don't have any money on me.\"\\n\\nOccasionally, \"friends\" she never recognizes would come and ask if they could borrow money from Asta. However, it's the first time she actually heard someone offer to pay her back. Her eyes widen in surprise. Listening in, her mother can't help but laugh.\\n\\n\"You're still a kid. What kind of work can you do?\"\\n\"Fight.\"\\n\"That's not a good job. How about this — I'll give you a job.\"\\n\\nTo this day, in Asta's heart, the bill for Arlan's meal was settled the moment he said that he'd pay her back.", "4": "\"The stars follow their own orbits, but what about humans... Can we humans ever hope to control our own destiny?\"\\n\\nA wealthy family background grants Asta the power to explore the stars, but also become her personal shackles.\\n\\nAs she grows older, Asta's vow to become an astronomer was viewed as increasingly radical by her family. She begins to lose count of how many times she'd argue during family meetings about this very thing.\\n\\nUntil one day, after a family meeting, a puppet girl walks in, And one of the family members who were so domineering a moment ago suddenly changes into a yes-man.\\n\\n\"That's the girl.\"\\n\"But she'd...\"\\n\"No buts. I didn't come all this way to listen to your garbage academic reports. I'd rather listen to this girl debate with you.\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"I want to see her on the space station within three days.\"\\n\\nAnd with that, the puppet girl walks straight out without looking back.", "5": "After becoming the Lead Researcher of the Herta space station, Asta's life is now busier than ever before. She has to manage the researchers and their differing opinions, reply to the numerous correspondence meant for Herta, constantly negotiate with the IPC, and procure equipment from various different sources... But at the same time, she's experiencing the greatest freedom she'd ever known...\\n\\n\"Deploy the Nyul Iman telescope in the second equipment bay. Set it to 100× astronomical units, and begin observation of the pre-stellar core in front of us.\"\\n\"Pay close attention to particle density. If you discover any super-dense structures, commence recording of the protostar fragmentation process at once.\"\\n\\nIn her spare time, Asta would sometimes consider how Madam Herta never seems to come around anymore after Asta arrived at the space station. She even made inquiries, but was told, \"If there's no interesting new stuff, I won't bother coming in.\"\\n\\n\"...I'd rather listen to this girl debate with you.\"\\n\\nShe thought back to the words Herta had casually told her family on that day long age.\\n\\nThe Herta of her memories seems to stand out amongst resplendent starlight, giving her the power to control the starry sky — and her own destiny."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Spectrum Beam", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Fire DMG equal to 50% of Asta's ATK to a single

Just as the vastness of the sky was dissected by that monstrous steel disc, perhaps the freedom she yearned for was also destined to be incomplete.\\n\\nShe struggled to break free from this quagmire, silently recording the ideals that she'd come to implement in her life on that dusty stone road.\\n\\n\"Make the world a better place.\"", "3": "Sitting on her mother's lap, cold arms wrapped around her neck, she felt an indescribable sense of security.

Her mother knew what she liked, and those fairy tales with happy endings would just leave her feeling bored and arise far too many questions. Telling stories with bad endings is an excellent way to lure the girl into falling asleep at night.\\n\\n\"Mother...

She led a crack squad of about a dozen soldiers deep behind enemy lines, fighting bravely until they ran out of ammo and food. As they made their way to the evac point, the terrifying Fragmentum creatures ambushed her — but the fatal attack was blocked by a brave private at the cost of his life. She didn't even have the time to see the face of her savior.\\n\\nThe prolonged wail of the funeral horn rang out. The young captain saw her grief, and came to her side.\\n\\n\"The coffin's empty.

She is accustomed to being on her own.\\nThe protectors and the protected, the oppressors and the oppressed... The world Seele grew up knowing was just a simple dichotomy...\\nThat is, until \"that girl\" appeared.", "2": "Seele's first fight in her life was for herself.\\n\\nBack then, she would wander aimlessly through the alleyways each day. When she was thirsty, she'd beg for water at the orphanage. When she was hungry, she'd swap scraps she found with the merchants for biscuits. Everyone in the dark side of Rivet Town knew that fearless homeless girl, and everyone was keen to avoid this wild, stubborn little rascal.\\n\\nOne hot evening, she felt very thirsty from too much playing. She arrived at the orphanage to discover the bucket containing water from the well is almost empty. Another shriveled homeless man was also there trying to get a drink — and after a power struggle which involved fists and even teeth, the man fled and Seele earned the right to slake her thirst alone.\\n\\nSeele saw the man three days later. Through the window of the clinic, she saw that wizened figure at death's door, lying on a stretcher.\\n\\nEver since then, she's always left a little water in the bucket for the people coming later.", "3": "As a child, Seele only ever went up to the Overworld once. That was after she'd met Oleg — who at the time was still captain of the Underworld's Silvermane Guards. Oleg hid Seele in his supply bag one day and took her up to the Overworld by cable car to give her a peek at the city she yearned for.\\n\\nSeele followed Oleg around the sights of Belobog, eating delicious foods and dressing up in splendid clothes beyond her wildest imagination. She scared off a group of kids with her uncouth miner slang, which caused Oleg to burst out into laughter. Those two short days were full of joy and laughter.\\n\\nBefore leaving that evening, they sat on a bench in the Administrative District Plaza as Seele stared at the restaurant opposite them.\\n\\n\"Was the Overworld fun, Seele? Wanna come back again later?\"\\n\"Can I ask you something?\"\\n\"...What's up? Ask away.\"\\n\"Those Overworlders are only eating half their meal, and threw the rest away.\"\\n\"...\"\\n\"Do they know that people down below haven't got enough food to eat?\"\\n\"...\"\\n\\nOleg saw how a look of gloom passed over her tender face.\\n\\n\"Let's go back, Oleg. I don't want to come back here again.\"", "4": "Lying on the clinic's bed, Seele is finally able to calm herself down as she silently thought over her experiences since becoming a member of Wildfire.\\n\\nInjuries and blood are routine occurrences for her. Seele has a better-than-average tolerance for pain, which allows her to fully unleash herself in combat — ignoring any lingering bumps and bruises.\\n\\nWounds will always heal, just as the threat of the Fragmentum will always grow. Just as people always return to their boring lives once rescued. Sometimes, a misconception would pop up in Seele's mind, as if time in the Underworld had come to a standstill... It somehow seems that all the efforts she and Wildfire had made are all in vain.\\n\\nThe doctor comes over and gently asks about her injury. Seele struggles to organize words, and conveys her confusion to the doctor.\\n\\n\"What's more important than miracles, Seele,\" the doctor says with a smile as she places her palm lightly on Seele's forehead, \"is to protect people's hopes for miracles.\"", "5": "The Administrative District Plaza is a crowded place, and it's where almost half the residents of Belobog are now gathering. Suppressing her disdain for bustling crowds, Seele scans across the faces in the Plaza with her careful gaze.\\n\\nHer hard work pays off, and she soon locks onto a target. A man wearing a gray hat, his hands in his pockets, is scuttling back and forth through the crowds while slyly looking from side to side with a sharp expression. After confirming that nobody is watching — at least, so he thinks — the man reaches out to grab the satchel of the woman beside him.\\n\\nBut before his fingers could reach the bag's zip, a slender but forceful hand quickly grabs his wrist. He nearly cries out with the pain, but Seele clasps her other hand over his mouth.\\n\\n\"Not a peep from you.\"\\n\\nThe majestic cry of horns resounds throughout the skies, and the bustling crowd falls silent immediately. A man in a comical outfit rushes to the podium, and shouts in a piercing voice —\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! For the ribbon-cutting part of this ceremony, please welcome to the stage — the Supreme Guardian herself, Madam Bronya Rand!\"\\n\\nDeafening cheers erupt from the plaza. Seele quietly pulls the pickpocket out of the crowd during the ruckus, and escorts him to the Silvermane Guards on duty. She turns to look back at the distant stage, and briefly locks eyes with the woman in the white dress. The Supreme Guardian flashes her an ever-so-brief smile, and Seele nods slightly in response.\\n\\nAnd then, they go their separate ways — one stepping into the light, the other into the shadows.\\n— One day, they will finally meet again."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Thwack", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 50% of

Well, that's even better — drop into our Neverwinter Workshop in the Administrative District to rock this city — with Mechanical Fever!\"", "3": "Serval Landau owns a piece of land in the heart of Belobog's Administrative District — the Neverwinter Workshop — where she in theory makes a living from her mechanical repairs.\\n\\nBut to be more precise, almost all of this genius mechanic's time is spent repairing and making improvements to various musical instruments...\\n\\n\"Tsk, don't pay any attention to that magazine! I'm a reputable business owner...\"\\n\"From geomarrow radiators to car engines — or even a Silvermane automaton — it's no trouble at all. As well as maintenance and renovations of ordinary appliances, I also provide a modding service.\"\\n\"Like fitting an external drill bit to a snowplow, or a ballistic trajectory calculator to a toaster... That kinda stuff.\"\\n\\n\"Ah? You want to know how's business going? Hey, don't ask so many questions — you know I like to fool around with music in my spare time.\"\\n\"Anyway, I never planned on making a fortune... Life's too short. Why not plunge yourself into your hobbies?\"", "4": "Serval was able to rekindle her passion for music after cutting off all connections with her family.\\n\\nThis led to her prestigious workshop becoming a base for her to rock out — despite suffering constant complaints, this cutting-edge art style from before the Eternal Freeze is still sought out by hordes of hipster kids...\\n\\n\"Oh, I give up! Can you trashy tabloids and your so-called \"music critics\" focus on what's important, please? 'Suffering constant complaints'... 'hipster kids'... My fans and I would dispute that!\"\\n\"But I suppose it's true that Mechanical Fever is popular with youths — at that age, kids are either full of enthusiasm or are underappreciated...\"\\n\"No matter what your mood is, you always have to vent sometimes. And rocking out with me just so happens to be the best way of doing that!\"\\n\\n\"...Just like what I did back in the day.\"\\n\"Ahh, it's fine! Don't worry. I was just suddenly reminiscing about the past...\"", "5": "In days gone by, everyone knew that Serval Landau was the smartest out of all the Silvermane Guards — 80% of the rumors about the talented elder daughter of the Landaus are based around this fact.\\n\\nHowever those rumors were almost instantly replaced by a new piece of gossip a few years ago. Why was she, who had always been close with the Supreme Guardian, being fired from the armed forces with no prior warning? Does Serval hold a grudge about it? Everyone has their own theory.\\n\\n\"The answer to the first question is simple: 'No comment.' This is the Silvermane Guards's top secret. I hope you understand.\"\\n\"And as for the second question...\"\\n\\n\"I... I don't give two hoots. Think about it. Is there anything better than living out a justifiably leisurely life? I prefer to say that woman helped me out — I really owe her a debt!\"\\n\"In this world, it's better to enjoy the present moment... No, who am I kidding.\"\\n\\n\"If our ends are already doomed, there will be no such thing as true joy.\""}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Roaring Thunderclap", "SkillTag": "Single Target",

The celebration reached its climax at an awards ceremony for the Silvermane Guards.\\n\\nUnder the watchful gaze of the crowds, the Supreme Guardian presented an award to the greatest soldiers for outstanding military service. This young captain from a noble house quietly puts on the arm armor forged out of Geomarrow — Light, flexible, and strong, while radiating a light reminiscent of auroras — That's the only impression he had of this treasure.\\n\\nHow many of his comrades' lives had been exchanged for such a glorious medal? He forces himself not to think about it. For now, he could only meet the expectations of the Supreme Guardian and all of Belobog with a smile — because this is what a loyal soldier must do.\\n\\nThe moment the captain finishes putting on the arm armor, a brilliant beam of light shoots out from the joints between the plates. The crowd erupts into a spontaneous and prolonged applause.\\n\\nNobody sees the weary faces beneath the helmets of those Silvermane Guards — they merely thought this is a triumphant victory.", "4": "The Supreme Guardian made the correct choice.\\n\\nAfter the war, many residents of Belobog could finally let out a sigh of relief and pick up the pieces of their simple lives.

Without outside help, this protracted war would usher in the demise of all Belobog.\\n\\nRight now, he is checking whether his shield, Earthwork, is still functioning as before. This heavy force field device was hand-crafted by his sister out of an instrument case — and if anything is broken, the poor captain would have to rely on his rockstar of a sister to help fix it.\\n\\n\"Gepard, if — and I do mean, if — \" he thinks back to her words, \"If one day, the Supreme Guardian orders you to abandon the people of Belobog to complete some goal of hers...

She believes locking the gates is an 'incomprehensible' act. I responded with my predicted calculations: By over-committing her resources to the war against the Fragmentum , the Supreme Guardian is accelerating the destruction of the Overworld. Isolation would be the best option for the people of the Underworld — this would buy them more time to try and survive. In the end, Clara finally agreed.\"\\n\\n\"Most humans behave illogically, but Clara doesn't — she is raised by me and grew up among automatons, and her behavior is more based on pure rationality.

However, unless new external forces intervene, the probability of this is less than 0.25272%, which places it in the low probability category. Further research on these calculations are paused.\"\\n\\n\"Today, the probability of survival in the Underworld has not seen a significant upward trend over the last five cycles.

She lifts her phone and captures the night sky — clear, cloudless, and almost never seen within the walls of Belobog. Without wind nor snow nor stratocumulus to deny her gaze, only the dark velvet of the void stand companion to the scintillating canopy made up of shimmering stars.\\n\\nClick... and sent.\\n\\nThe signal isn't very good. The air congeals with the ascension of altitude. Snow and night make silent bedfellows. Not long after, the sound of clicking is followed by a series of rings. It turns out the girl just finished her manuscript: the summit, the night, the stars.\\n\\nLynx smirks and points her lens at her tent, its shape inflating like a lung filling with breath. Again, she pressed down and snapped her shots. Click. Send.\\n\\nDing. The screen soon lights up again. This time, what is displayed is a woman's workbench, schematics and utensils strewn beneath the darkness of dimmed lights.\\n\\nClick. Camping chairs and Lynx's favorite velvet blanket.\\nDing. A glass of tepid milk.\\n\\nClick. A cup of black tea steaming with warmth.\\nDing. An iron table lamp and a girl's favorite picture album.\\n\\nClick. A warm sleeping bag.\\nDing. Disheveled bedding.\\n\\nClick. A mountain top view towards Belobog, gazing upon the golden waves.\\nDing. The shimmering streets of the Administrative District outside an apartment window.\\n\\nClick.\\nLast was the resplendent aurora lights dancing in night sky in a sudden instant.\\nDing.\\nA cute sticker follows. Lynx knows that girl only sends this one when she expresses envy.\\n\\nSo, she carefully makes a selection from her photos as a response...\\n\\n\"This will be good enough.\" They have tacit understanding of each other.", "5": "\"Why did Lynx choose to become a polar explorer?\"\\n\\nLynx's close friend once asked her this question. At that time, she had no idea how to reply, so she brushed the inquiry off like a joke.\\n\\nHowever, after that, Lynx also began to think about this question over and over again herself. Was she truly interested in ancient Belobogian history or geography? Or did she actually want to avoid socializing in a city trapped in eternal winter? Or...\\n\\nOr perhaps the girl didn't even realize that, to Lynx, the way Landaus do things is pretty simple.\\n\\n\"If you want to do something, go for it.\"\\n\\nServal was obsessed with machinery and music, so she ran the workshop and became a rock musician. Gepard wanted to protect Belobog, so he became a Silvermane Guard captain.\\n\\nTherefore, when Lynx suddenly announced to the family: \"I want to venture deep into the Snow Plains,\" it was also simple as that.\\n\\nAfraid of the cold? Then wear something warm. Afraid of the danger? Then learn survival skills. No one's done it before? Then Lynx can be the first one.\\n\\n\"After all, isn't it simple to just go from start to goal's end?\""}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Ice Crampon Technique", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 25% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 30% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 35% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 40% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 45% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 50% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 55% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 60% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 65% of this character's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Salted Camping Cans", "SkillTag": "Restore", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Applies \"Survival Response\" to a single target ally and increases their Max HP by 5% of Lynx's Max HP plus 50.

Skilled in mixed martial arts and is a Wildfire member.\\nFrom the fight cage to the battlefield, and from a fighter to a warrior, Luka uses his strength to protect the people of the Underworld.\\nHe wishes to bring hope to others precisely because he had experienced despair himself.", "2": "He lifts the steel hammer over and over.\\n\\nSparks erupt before his eyes, and the clang of metal against metal mutes the thuds of moving muscles and joints. The boy is not yet tall enough to reach the tools at the top of the steel cabinet, but the power with which he swings the steel hammer can already rival that of the most skilled craftsmen.\\n\\nThis shop is his entire life, with his father squatting next to the door and repeatedly cleaning the rusted old shop sign. Sometimes he would lie on his hard bed and imagine his future — but no matter where his mind wandered, his father's figure would always appear in his thoughts at the end.\\n\\nHe temporarily puts down his work as footsteps approach. His father stands up, and the older man's stout but bowed figure moves with a hint of groveling flattery. It's those people from Wildfire again. Ever since Moltammerville went under a curfew, they have been frequenting this shop and have increased the number of orders for various weapons.\\n\\nAs the boy thinks about this, he happens to stare into the eyes of that regular old customer who acts as the leader of the group. That man's skin is tanned and he stands tall, his sharp gaze immediately softens when he locks eyes with the boy. Then, he nods imperceptibly at the boy.\\n\\n\"Welcome, Chief Oleg! How can I help you today?\"\\n\"Patience, my good sir. I'm just here for a chat today.\" The man points at Luka. \"A chat about your son.\"", "3": "There is fire all around him, and the thick black smoke makes it hard to see. He keeps hearing screams and screeches as the fused scent of machine oil and blood sweeps over his nostrils. Luka tries hard to push down the urge to vomit.\\n\\nThe smile that Oleg wore on his face when Luka swung a perfect straight punch for the first time inspired Luka. However, once the boy had experienced the cruelty of the front lines first-hand, he never regained that warm feeling in his heart. Luka would secretly observe his comrades' expressions every time they lined up for action — and the apprehension he saw on those faces would actually soothe his own anxiety.\\n\\nA scream pulls Luka back to reality. He rushes toward where the sound came from and sees a helpless child being backed into a corner by a monster. Instinctively, he leaps out and puts himself between the sharp ax and the child's fragile form.\\n\\nA loud blast sounds from behind him. Luka hugs the panicked boy with one arm and slowly turns his head. The mutated monster had fallen to the ground, seemingly hit in the vitals by a stray bullet.\\n\\n\"Th—Thank you... mister...\"\\n\\n\"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\"\\n\\n\"Mister... your... your arm...\"\\n\\nHis eyes follow the direction the child is pointing at. The sleeve that should have covered his upper right arm has been reduced to a shred of broken fabric, and blood is pouring out of his severed limb.\\n\\nHowever, before he faints from the pain, he could once again feel that warmth swelling up in his heart.", "4": "Luka is defeated at the final stage during the first championship he takes part in.\\n\\n\"Hahaha, how useless! This is the world of survival of the fittest — someone as weak as you shouldn't even show yourself before me!\"\\n\\nLuka does not mind the humiliation. His opponent for the final is an infamous thug in town known for his underhanded and cruel tactics. If I have to resort to this kind of tricks and deceit to become the champion — Luka thinks — then I'd rather never get my hands on the golden belt.\\n\\nLuka runs into a few children around the corner from the Fight Club the night after. A short and skinny boy is curled up on the ground, his body covered in wounds while the older children surrounding him laugh in arrogance.\\n\\n\"Hahaha, how useless!\" The leader of the bullies points at the wounded boy. \"This is the world of survival of the fittest — someone as weak as you shouldn't even show yourself before me!\"\\n\\nThat is when Luka swears he will become the Underworld champion — and he will do it his own way: fair and square.", "5": "\"We'll call it a day here. Come, boy. Take a seat.\"\\n\\n\"...This is all? I was planning to practice a few more sets today!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, c'mon, stop pushing yourself. Get over here!\"\\n\\n\"Hahaha. I'm coming. I'm coming!\"\\n\\n\"Boy, I'm gonna ask you a question, and you need to give me an honest answer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh? What is this heart-to-heart we're having? Go on. Ask away.\"\\n\\n\"Look, when it comes to fighting... Do you actually like fighting?\"\\n\\n\"Hahaha! Why are you asking this all of a sudden? Of course I do! Why else would I stick with you for so long?\"\\n\\n\"Don't be smart with me, boy! Answer the question!\"\\n\\n\"You're really serious about this... Okay. To be completely honest? I don't like it that much.\"\\n\\n\"Mmm... finally got an honest answer out of you. So, if the Underworld no longer needs Wildfire's protection... would you still train yourself as a fighter?\"\\n\\n\"Mmm, lemme think... I probably will.\"\\n\\n\"Why? You didn't get into fighting because you want the golden belt. Don't think you can hide that from me. If the Underworld really became peaceful one day... would you still have a reason to fight?\"\\n\\n\"Sir, I remember you saying that there are bad people in every era. Even if all the Fragmentum monsters die off, people would still fight to the death for every little thing.\"\\n\\n\"Hmm... I did say that.\"\\n\\n\"As long as there are still bad people in this world, and as long as there are still good people I need to protect—\" Luka stands up, \"then I will keep on fighting!\""}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Direct Punch", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 50% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 60% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 70% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 80% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 90% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 1% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 110% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 120% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 130% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Lacerating Fist", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 60% of Luka's ATK to a single enemy target.

I also believe that ███'s career will most certainly not stop here, not with the potential she has shown so far. She will definitely rise to bigger and better things in the future.

She would never slack off in slacking off.\\nFollowing her parents' wishes, Qingque qualified for the Divination Commission, but the relaxing post she was expecting was in fact a brutal, high-intensity workplace.\\nAfter several years of work, Qingque has honed her skills — no matter which department she's transferred to, she's still the lowest-leveled diviner.\\nShe would browse books and play ancient tile games to wile away the hours... What more could one ask for than a life like this?", "2": "The legend of Qingque begins at the lyceum.\\n\\nFrom the time of Qingque's freshman year right through to her graduation, whenever exam grades were announced, the word Qingque was always followed by a number written out in full: 60, with no exception.\\n\\nAt first, her tutors thought that Qingque was just an average talent unsuitable for academia, so they didn't really look into things. However, as the same number kept turning up in the examination records, her tutors began to suspect that this wasn't a coincidence at all.\\n\\nVery soon, having long conversations with the tutors became a common occurrence for Qingque. Anyone familiar with this kind of sophistry will recognize that handful of sayings: at first, she's \"quiet and well-behaved,\" or \"gifted.\" Then, later on the tone will shift to blame, \"A pity that big brain of yours is going to waste,\" before the grand finale:\"If only you could dedicate such ingenuity to your studies, then blah blah blah...\"\\n\\nBut Qingque knew the kind of life she wanted far better than her tutors do. She kept repeating \"Oh, yes yes yes,\" and \"Mmm sure sure sure,\" before turning straight around to fall asleep at her desk, and just scraping by during the next exam — this was how Qingque responded to the coercion and threats of her tutors.\\n\\nThey finally ran out of patience with her. In the end, they could only leave behind a resentful message in her yearbook:\\n\\n\"It'd be difficult for her to achieve greatness\"", "3": "During the ten-plus years at the Divination Commission, Qingque kept a low-key existence like a harmless little sparrow.\\n\\nFollowing her parents' expectations and holding down a steady job, Qingque thought she could breathe a sigh of relief. However, she didn't realize that the Divination Commission — which is in charge of gathering, collecting, and sorting information — is an endless sea of misery for slackers, with no end to the effort it demands. This high-intensity work drove Qingque into torment, from which she could not escape.\\n\\nHowever, as the saying goes, \"what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\" Struggling through the endless days of being a lifelong \"professional,\" Qingque became a seasoned slacker and learned more than a few slick tricks to loaf on the job. She's transferred throughout the departments and worked under several bosses. Every time, she's always the lowest-leveled diviner, with her numbers threatening to go even lower. It can be said that this has been... pleasing.\\n\\nHowever, there are two things that still trouble her. One is visiting her parents during New Year for an annual catch-up, talking about life and her plans for the future — because she doesn't have any plans at all. The other is that pesky boss of hers who's more accurate than a jade abacus at piling new work on her whenever she's busted slacking off.\\n\\nQingque is determined to keep improving her time management skills and escape the terror of being pursued by her superior in the Divination Commission. What a shame that Qingque fails to understand fate supersedes her. Her every thought is well within the purview of the omniscia.", "4": "The game of Celestial Jade is supposed to have been around since the days of the Primeval Imperium, but was lost during the Xianzhou Alliance's period of long interstellar drift. Thanks to an anonymous diviner at the Divination Commission, the rules have been collated and brought back to modern-day Xianzhou, where the people are fortunate enough to have access to this mind-boggling tile game based on astrophysics and celestial phenomena.\\n\\nOf course, rules alone are not enough. That's why the diviner used blueprints from her repository as bait to lure in close colleagues from the Artisanship Commission into crafting Celestial Jade tiles plus a board to play on. The auto-shuffling function is integrated into these boards, and quickly began to catch on in the Quatraboard Games Parlor (which is owned by the Artisanship colleague).\\n\\nNowadays, Celestial Jade is one of the most popular games aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. The diviner would joke about this in letters sometimes with her artisan friend. She'd originally wanted to use this game for nothing more than her own leisure, not to capture the hearts of millions of Xianzhou people. Now that's a completely unintended outcome.\\n\\n\"Well, it's not a bad thing...\"\\n\"After all... If I can use this leisurely brain game to slack off out in the open, then why not go for it?\"", "5": "\"Being happy at work is an artform.\"\\n\\n\"First, never overdo any task. Higher-ups want to see their tasks progressing at a consistent pace before the deadline, so never turn in anything early.\"\\n\\n\"Second, never take the initiative. If higher-ups don't personally tell you what they want you to do, that is not your problem.\"\\n\\n\"Third, don't work hard by yourself, and never fight for clout. If you can, try and drag someone in to suffering together with you. Whatever you do, never work alone for the sake of trying to demonstrate any kind of ability.\"\\n\\n\"Afterward, you can give credit to your peers, both as an easy hat-tip or simple investment into your future. But also as a shield against the possibility of higher-ups promoting you — a promotion means even more work.\"\\n\\n\"The point is, there are three basic principles for happiness at work – do not be proactive, do not say no, and do not be responsible.

As a result of her supervision, the Xianzhou trade fairs are now known throughout the cosmos.\\n\"Try one's best to avoid conflict when possible, and persuade those who can be persuaded\" — that's Tingyun's motto.", "2": "There's a saying: \"Foxians are born to do business.\" Linger a little while at the Sleepless Earl teahouse, and you'll come to appreciate this fact.\\n\\n\"There's something you don't know,\" says that Foxian woman, wafting her exquisite reticulated fan as she gazes at the skeptical man before her, \"different lands raise their special type of life. If Sandcitrus seeds from the Bitterwater Confederacy are transplanted into the sacred soils of Vonwacq, then they will grow into sweet oranges. This is naturally due to the fertile and balanced soils of Vonwacq. And if the lightfish fry from Thalassa are introduced to my world and raised by the Vidyadhara at Scalegorge Waterscape, they can double in size to over three feet long.\"\\n\\n\"The Whistling Flames' latest plan is to carefully select species with commercial potential, and relay them via trade starskiffs for safe transport. Within one month, you'll get the first batch of goods back. These goods would add to the glamours of the crystal palace at the bottom of the Thalassan abyss, and can even become a unique trading products for your nation.\"\\n\\nThe man with gills blows out a few bubbles, which represents a slightly hesitant agreement in his culture. Then, his larynx pronounces some wondrous syllables: \"I thought the Whistling Flames were speculative traders involved in arbitrage. Are you planning to change the current situation in the logistics industry, where the IPC reigns supreme? Tell me, how much do you want?\"\\n\\n\"For a return service, we take ninety percent. A broker just flips product from one hand to the other. Or rather, from one finned limb to the other. As the saying goes, \"Real business talks no profit.\" Only by benefiting others can we hope to benefit ourselves. As long as the Lord of the Abyss in the Crystal Palace assents, then I'd like to enter into a contr— Ahem, I mean a permanent partnership. What do you say?\"\\n\\nOn this day, Tingyun not only closed on a deal, but also formed a new friendship for the Alliance.", "3": "Tingyun was always different from the others.\\n\\nFoxians are synonymous with the quick and the agile. Their lightning-fast reflexes and keen senses have resulted in this, and it also makes for cheeky, playful juvenile Foxians. But Tingyun? This pointy-eared girl always looks fluffy and soft. Not only does she not vigorously pull on others' fur when meeting someone, she herself remains calm even if someone pulls on her fur. With an innocent smile and her sweet voice, she would even urge the other person to stop...\\n\\nIt's not hard to understand differences in human nature. But compared to her Foxian peers all busy tearing up their homes, Tingyun — who'd never been any good at combat — frustrated her parents who both served in the military at the Sky-Faring Commission. Seeing as Tingyun wouldn't inherit the family business, the two shook off their prejudices and let their daughter blossom freely...\\n\\nAs a result, a dazzling new star of trade dawned aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. With her warm personality and talented skills, this Foxian girl successively completed trade missions to sixteen different planets, and re-signed another bilateral agreement with the IPC. The famous Xianzhou trade bonanza — the Grand Fair — also developed into a famous fiesta under her advocacy.", "4": "Speaking of Tingyun's six-ribbed reticulated fan, it is a well-known ingenium made by the Artisanship Commission.\\n\\nMost merchants carry weapons in self-defense while traveling, but Tingyun is an exception — she refuses to equip any weapons that do not conform to her style, such as blades, lances, swords, and halberds, which are strong but ungraceful. And she considers booby-traps like darts and needles to be too toxic and disgraceful.\\n\\nAfter thinking over things, Tingyun finally chose this carved reticulated fan. Put into her own words, here's why:\\n\\n\"Business people cherish peace above all else. Carrying a weapon dishonors friendships and makes for bad business.\"\\n\\n\"My fan is different from a weapon. I can use it to cool myself off as well as cooling off a nasty business client. It's best if we can just have a nice chat, but if things don't go smoothly...\"\\n\\n\"...Then I just have to fan them harder, and cool them off until they know I mean business!\"", "5": "However, if she ever hopes to be promoted to Helm Master, Tingyun's gentle personality will shift from being a strength to a stumbling block — after all, the Sky-Faring Commission has always been run by ace pilots, all of them warriors baptized by the flames of war. Meanwhile, Tingyun doesn't have the knack for driving a starskiff, let alone a skill for killing. That's the main difference between her and the current Helm Master of the Sky-Faring Commission, Yukong.\\n\\nWhat's more, Yukong has already planned on handing over the future to Tingyun, but Tingyun doesn't know if she's truly qualified to take it on.\\n\\nTo her, Yukong is not merely a trustworthy superior or even a savior during a crisis. In her heart, Yukong is also a kind of glorious idol. She views Yukong as someone to entrust her spirits in, as a beacon to guide her. She wants to hold onto that starlight, but has discovered that she can only chase in desperation from the shadows. Until one day, that lone star said to her:\\n\\n\"Times are changing. Xianzhou is changing. One day, this giant ship will grow utterly exhausted of a sky full of blood and war. When that time comes, the Sky-Faring Commission will be your stage.\"\\n\\nShe didn't know how much of what was said was a joke, but she carefully sealed these words into the envelope and locked it in the back of the drawer at her store. She resolved to never forget.\\n\\n\"Even if I can't go into battle, there's still a chance for me to show my strength.\" Says the Foxian girl to herself. The Luofu is currently moored in orbit, undergoing re-invigoration after a campaign against the abominations. Flourishing commerce becomes the backdrop to this era.\\n\\nUnderstanding Yukong's expectations of her, Tingyun flies beyond the skies, seeking more alliances and friendships.\\n\\n\"When it comes to who is the best helm master on the Luofu, people will naturally say Madam Yukong's the champion.

Although his appearance may be one of indolence, he is more meticulous than seemingly meets the eye. He does not consider saving a situation from the brink of disaster to be a show of wisdom, and is thus fastidious with routine affairs to avoid any potential problems. Due to his careful management, Xianzhou has enjoyed many years of peace, with Jing Yuan's seemingly lazy demeanor having earned him the moniker of the \"Dozing General.\"", "2": "\"Master Diviner, why do we use a square board but round pieces for starchess?\"\\n\"Perhaps it's based around the round sky and square earth? Ancient civilizations believed the earth was flat. This set is modeled after the old days of nation-states and imperial conquest over a singular planet, so naturally it's square. As for the pieces... People back then believed the sky was a round dome, and chess pieces spun around like stars in that dome to reflect in human lives. That's why they are also round.\" \\n\"No, no. That's incorrect.\"\\n\"I've already predicted your next forty-eight moves. Jing Yuan, if you want to distract me with questions, I urge you to stop.\"\\n\"Ah, how could you suspect such malice?\"\\n\"Don't interrupt me. Keep talking.\"\\n\"It's true that chess is a metaphor and describes the human condition. The rules of war are clearly established, with each piece's actions fixed — advance, retreat, and jump. Advance or retreat is always in an orderly manner, which is why the board's square in its orderliness. As for the pieces, the sages said \"use intellect with subtlety and suaveness.\" As each piece is meant to be sentient individuals, they are therefore circular.\"\\n\"The origins of starchess are covered in the Gleaned Pearls of Verdure.

Haha, how can the head of a Commission act like a sore loser?\"", "3": "Of an alliance spanning six mighty Xianzhou ships, the Cloud Knights emerged out of the ashes of the Flaming Catastrophe. They swore an oath to defend the Xianzhou ships and follow Reignbow's decree of The Hunt, a tradition carried out to this day. Despite the incredible longevity of long-life species, few generals have been able to pass the century mark after taking up the mantle due to the bloody nature of warfare. This is not so much fate as it is tradition. As the armed defenders of Xianzhou against crusading abominations, generals not only must take the lead for planning and dispatching, but also take the lead into battle. Amidst countless names erased too quickly and too cruelly in the annals of history, the Divine Foresight Jing Yuan, leader of the Cloud Knights of the Xianzhou Luofu, stands out from the rest with his centuries-old reign. Under his wise strategy, the Luofu's Cloud Knights have made a name for themselves among the Alliance, achieving an exemplary record. While there are those who complained that he feared combat so much so that he seldom resorted to arms, it remains true that his intellect is no less resourceful than the tip of the sharpest sword in solving thorny problems.", "4": "One of the hottest pieces of gossip making the rounds today contends that Jing Yuan's family has served the Realm-Keeping Commission for generations.\\n\\nAccording to the Foxian custom of having babies \"picking\" their future, parents will put various objects and toys around an infant cub, and get them to choose their future career path by grabbing an item. Jing Yuan's parents hoped he would inherit the mantle of a scholar or official at the Realm-Keeping Commission, but Jing Yuan grabbed the toy sword.\\n\\nIt seems like prediction from the birthfate tradition came true. After graduating from the academy, Jing Yuan joined the Cloud Knights to escape from a \"typical\" life against his family's wishes.\\n\\nHis first expedition was recorded in the official Cloud Knights' battle record. The Navis Astriger carrying the troops had to make a forced landing on an ocean planet infested by abominations. One new long-life species known as Puppeteer Jellyfish hijacked the Cloud Knights' minds, stowing onto the ship and almost converting their warship into an alien hive. Jing Yuan quickly became aware of the crisis and identified the requirements of Puppeteer Jellyfish possession, then devised a way against them. The rest of the crew eventually passed this ordeal amongst identical friends and foes, defeated the real enemies, and returned home to safety.\\n\\nThis bloodless victory showed Jing Yuan's mettle to the Cloud Knights' generals. After returning to the Xianzhou, Jing Yuan demonstrated his adept skill and was appointed to a position of importance in the Knights.\\n\\nHis quick-witted and practical approaches had repeatedly given his superiors unforgettable surprises — and headaches. In the end, Jing Yuan was invited by the previous Sword Champion of the Luofu to join her team, and so the legend of the High-Cloud Quintet was formed.", "5": "As the most famous legend in Xianzhou history, the five heroes of the High-Cloud Quintet gathered to fight together. Their feats were almost endless: Driving out the borisin invading Thalassa. Destroying the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and the wingweavers in the Abundance Axis. Even rescuing the Xianzhou Yuque and defeating the living planet Ketu Mirage, preserving the eyes of the Alliance that gaze out to the stars...\\n\\nHowever, all their achievements were no match for the cruelty of time. The High-Cloud Quintet fell apart after less than a hundred short years. As wars waned, the major ships went their separate ways as the Luofu began patrolling cosmic trade routes, seeking out supplies and support for the Alliance.\\n\\nOld friendships became scattered to the winds, and enemies were either captured or dead. Only memories remain. Fallen generals don't have to endure such torment, but those who survive have to go through it all, no matter how great a vision one has dreamed of and no matter how many overwhelming enemies one has defeated, time will always reduce one's strength little by little yet cruelly spares one's life, leaving one cowering in a corner and hating one's own powerlessness.\\n\\nOnly the truly wise can stand

O, jade skies of flight. Starskiffs weave through the Grand Fair, and tourists flock the skygate. Anyone traveling in or out of the Luofu could see a vast gate when looking up, where a spacial membrane twirls like a torrent. The gate stands alone with no walls and admits the ships coming and going. It is a grand sight to see.\\n\\nThis skygate is called the Jade Gate, and it's the entrance to the Xianzhou delves. Below the gate, travelers stream inside on their way into the Luofu. Among them is a young girl wearing a peach-colored dress, likely of 16 or 17 years old, but difficult to judge her true age as a Xianzhou native — nor could anyone guess what strange force has helped her hold that enormous greatsword in her hand.\\n\\nAt two feet and one inch long, it's very unusual. Despite being wrapped in white cloth, it still looks like an antique. Yet it is a true weapon as the edges on both sides of the blade are as thin as cicada wings, sharp enough to even cut a strand of hair. People come to stare at this soldier girl, raising their eyebrows. But the girl seems to be accompanied by worry, merely frowning in annoyance as she mutters:\\n\"How strange! Mother taught me how to chant this mantra so that I could focus. Why isn't it working now?\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for her to utter any more obscure words, a Vidyadhara man at the custom raised his hand and waves the girl over: \"Next, please!\" The girl is startled and grits her teeth tightly — but she has to bite the bullet and steps forward.\\n\\n\"Gold can be smelted, but an oath...\" The girl says sternly to the Vidyadhara man.\\n\"Gold can be smelted, but an oath cannot be broken\". The Vidyadhara man blankly replies: \"This is the customs office. What oath? Name, origin, reason for travel — just give me these.\"\\nShe is dumbfounded, and figures she'd gotten her Luofu anecdote wrong. Helpless, she could only pick up her Foursquare Mirror and respond: \\n\"Name: Sushang; personal belongings: one Xuanyuan sword. Origin:...\"\\n\"Tsk, how do you write 'Yaoqing' again?\"", "3": "It has been some time since Sushang answered the call of the Luofu's Cloud Knights. She keeps herself busy patrolling the streets, but never runs into any criminal activity, which leaves her even more annoyed and angry. In the end, she has no choice but to practice sword training and listen to storytelling in her spare time. These boring days stretch on endlessly.\\n\\nOne day, she is lying on the table at the Sleepless Earl, waiting for the storyteller to get prepared and tell his tale of the Luofu's High-Cloud Quintet. But before the gavel could fall, her Cloud Knight peer bursts through the door, screaming out: \\n\"Sushang, come now! The Outworlders are making trouble again!\"\\n\\nAfter hearing the shout, her eyes widen instantly, and she quickly picks up her greatsword to rush to the scene. Upon arriving, she sees a redhead woman performing sword-swallowing and fire-breathing, which send the crowd into hysterics. Before long, this woman is somehow pulling out a green granite slab, determined to perform a \"Slab Chest Smash\" trick.\\n\\n\"Stop! The traffic here has always been a problem. This isn't your darned circus, okay!?\" Sushang shouts out sternly, steeling her stance as she heaves her Xuanyuan sword and points it at the woman. The woman notices her lack of stability and stays calm, side-stepping her before spinning up the fire-stick once more to great astonishment.\\n\\n\"I'll leave then out of respect!\" Says the redhead loudly. And with a wave of her hand, the blunt end of the redhead's spear stabs straight towards Sushang's clenched hands. Sushang backs away a pace, whereupon the woman unexpectedly takes several round objects out of her pouch, smashing them onto the ground to send smoke and fire in every direction, causing an incessant sound of explosions. When Sushang comes to, she realizes that the woman has disappeared: \\n\"What the heck was that... firecrackers!?\"\\n\"This Outworlder... Cannot be underestimated!\"", "4": "Dearest Mother and Father,\\n\\nHow have you two been? I've been fighting alongside the Cloud Knights on the Luofu for some time now as per your request, so that's something to report. I think I should share it here with the both of you!\\n\\nIn my opinion, the most important event lately should be... me independently handling someone dangerous without relying on anyone else! This Outworlder always goes around making trouble, and always packs lots of explosives, threatening public safety. But this person is forced into this by vicissitudes of life. Inspired by me, she decided to turn over a new page — and now, we're even close friends!\\n\\nI also follow your advice and continue to practice swordcraft every day. I feel like I've been making great progress. If I can go home and show you two, I think you'd be pleased with my progress!\\n\\nI remembered back when I set off that you asked me not be too whimsical and train myself with the army. Well, now I've practiced a lot here, I am gradually becoming more mature. I still have so much to learn, but I can looking after myself now! So you both don't have to worry about me!\\n\\nSushang\\nOctober 21", "5": "Sushang:\\n\\nReading your letter is almost as good as seeing you again in person. The two of us are safe and sound, so don't worry about us.\\n\\nAs for your recent situation you described in your letter, we understand and are deeply gratified. In addition, we've added some new instructions here and hope you're able to make an effort with these.\\n\\nFirstly, when making friends, you should consider if they're good or bad. Sushang, you're now old enough for courtship, but you still don't understand how unpredictable and dangerous the world can be. Your collusion with hoodlums has worried and aggrieved us. Straight-forward, trustworthy, and knowledgeable people are good and should make good friends. But expedient, soft, and flattering people are no good, and should be avoided.\\n\\nSecondly, don't strive to achieve grandiose things. We know you've always been anxious about justice, but your letter seems to have fact mixed in with fiction, or at the very least be greatly exaggerated. An old saying in Xianzhou goes, \"As reputation is never easily gained, so glory cannot be coincidence.\" It's not good to make achievements and then boast about them. Keep in mind: We Xianzhou people live forever, so fleeting fame and fortune pass through our fingers into the sands of time. It's why you need to build up a strong foundation and focus on the practical, being meticulous and careful as if skating on thin ice. One slip and you'll get into trouble, fall into the grasps of mara, and bear the consequences for life!\\n\\nPS: Keep your sword sharp every day, and don't forget to recite your Blade Swara to focus your spirit. The mind is the basis of martial arts, and when your mind gets refined into the formless, you can know that the sword is nothing but another crutch to rely on. Grass, wood, stone, bamboo and the alike can all make swords. Follow your heart and energies freely. It will take many a day yet for you to eventually tame your Xuanyuan sword.\\n\\nPPS: You made a lot of writing errors, Sushang. Please read more books while you're off duty.

This is an immense fortune you have been blessed with.\"\\n\\nAll the past is layered in the mists of probability, shifting on the edges of consciousness between dreams and reality, and extending forward into futures uncountable. She strove to find the day she became a diviner in the vastness of all moments.", "3": "On that day, Fu Xuan sought her master beneath the Cloudpeer Telescope of the Xianzhou Yuque, but found herself unable to believe that the man before her was the master diviner her elders had so reverently regarded. He wore a somewhat aged pilot's outfit and was unceremoniously seated on the ground, his attention dedicated entirely to the shifting of the interwoven light rays in the matrix.\\n\\n\"Your humble student, Fu Xuan, comes bearing her respects, Master Diviner.\" Such were the words spoken by the girl after a period of hesitation.\\n\\nThe man's gaze remained unwavering, as he simply raised a finger, beckoning her to look at the show. Fu Xuan noticed that his hand had, inexplicably, morphed into a wooden ingenium. \"The Yuque's Nephjade Orbit Fleet are currently laying out a defense at Thalassa in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. You should have heard of this, yes? However, they are fated to lose this battle.\"\\n\\n\"Huh? The Yaoqing is noted for its martial prowess and is rarely rivaled. According to intelligence, our forces outnumber and outmatch the borisin. How can victory be denied if an attack is commenced?\"\\n\\n\"Well asked. You don't seem like an apprentice that just accepts things.\" The man stood up and patted down his dust-coated sleeves.  \"A diviner knows fate without resigning to it. Treading through varied possibilities to find the best choice is indeed wise. But, sometimes, no matter how you choose, destiny will only grant you a single path forward. When the finalized divination presents you with only two outcomes, the bad and the worse, what will you choose?\"\\n\\n\"...Naturally, the choice should be the lesser of two evils. This is the first lesson of divination.\"\\n\\n\"But what if it's humanly impossible to judge matters at hand?\" The man turned.\\n\\n\"This divination is gleaned from the newly arranged 'Deca-Light Reflection Barrier' matrix. There are two outcomes: To temporarily transfer the Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, or to draw from the manpower of the Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet of the Fanghu. Only one choice can be made. To use the Crane Feather Orbit Fleet means being able to press a strong offense for some time but losing any hope of victory thereafter. To use the Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet, we must endure the vast distances between us and the Fanghu and have the conflict drag on for six months. During this time, we must also withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy, not to mention the losses that are certain to come. But should the defense hold until reinforcement arrives, then victory may well become possible.\"\\n\\n\"They went with the first option, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Correct. Divination can provide counsel and guidance, but only the general can make the final decision. He chose the path that would lead to the smallest loss. This didn't invalidate my divination, of course — defeat was the predetermined outcome.\"\\n\\n\"The treatises on the art of war state that an advantage in numbers speaks favorably for initiating battle, and calling on the aid of Yaoqing's forces may not be the worst possible decision. Moreover, nothing is ever certain in this world. How can you be so sure, master diviner? How can you speak as if all have been predestined?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is ever certain in this world?\" The man sighed heavily. \"I thought the same thing when the divination results appeared... I thought there must have been an error in the calculations. However, the results did not change after the re-analysis. I therefore resolved to head to the battlefield and seek evidence myself.\"\\n\\n\"I had ventured deep into Thalassa the past few weeks, fought the abominations, and gained the trust of the local water dwellers. That was how I received a shocking piece of news: Within a month's time, a great tide known to the Thalassans as the 'Devil's Tide' — caused by the gravitational influence of their moon — will arrive.\"\\n\\n\"None will be able to keep fighting the abominations in such abyssal conditions without the help from the Fanghu Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magi. This piece of intel does not exist on any guide, nor is it recorded in our army's data bank. Only that, in order to validate my results in a moment of superfluous effort, I gave my hand as the price.\"\\n\\nThe man smiled bitterly and lifted his wooden hand in a wave. \"Sometimes there is only ever one path in destiny. Everything is predetermined.\"\\n\\n\"By the way, you don't need to address me as master diviner. You should call me 'Teacher' from today onward.\"", "4": "She spent the happiest time in her life studying in the Yuque's Divination Commission. She learned about predestination versus free-will, about matrix calculations versus human choices... The girl recalled she was always arguing with her teacher on every issue regarding divination and fortune-telling. Those were not aggressive confrontations with sharp words, but heated discussions between peers. And yet, though the two agreed on many topics, there was one issue they could not come to a consensus —\\n\\nNous had granted divine volumes outlining the matrix calculations to the Xianzhou centuries ago. The Xianzhou Yuque's Divination Commission had pored over them to interpret and manifest the wisdom within, ultimately constructing the best divination matrix in the entire Alliance. Thought this is a point of pride for Yuque's diviners, Fu Xuan felt it was nothing short of culling the future possibilities of the Xianzhou people within the narrow path set out by the matrix.\\n\\nWhen people believe that the predictions of the matrix will always come to pass, then \"choice\" became an empty concept only for show. The diviners have unwillingly become prisoners of the matrix. They head to work when the hour is fortuitous, and stay home when the hour is ominous. What they do, what they avoid doing — everything was in accordance with the divination results.\\n\\n\"If the matrix tells me that I will die tomorrow, does that mean I should just hurry up and end myself? At that point, what is the difference between performing a divination and not performing one?\"\\n\\n\"The difference is that we know we walk on the ordained path set by the heavens. That is the supreme path sought by Grandmaster Xuan Yao, who initiated the Divination Commission system.\"\\n\\n\"All the diviner has to do is to faithfully believe and obediently follow the guidance of the matrix, and make one choice after another in that way — even though those choices may be ludicrous, incomprehensible, or difficult. All such efforts will ultimately lead the Xianzhou to the great work that it has been seeking throughout its existence — that of eradicating the Plagues Author and rid the world of the agony of Abundance.\" The man's expression was as placid and calm as an enlightened disciple who had received divine revelation. He looked at Fu Xuan and continued, \"just like how I chose to take you in as my student after knowing about your predetermined future.\"\\n\\nIt wasn't for my talents? And it wasn't for my well-connected family? It was just to fulfill some prediction? This... this was absurd! Rage took over Fu Xuan, and she was at a loss for words.\\n\\n\"Did I ever tell you that after I consulted the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier and interpreted the hexagram, I now firmly believe that my life will end in your hands? However, I still took you in as my student. I'm waiting for you to take over my position and become the Xianzhou Yuque's master diviner, because it has all been predetermined.\"\\n\\nPredetermined? His life will end in my hands?\\n\\nHe was talking as if the Xianzhou was still in the Three Sufferings Era! As if she was a treacherous disciple who craved the seat of the master diviner so much, that she would even kill her teacher for it! Her teacher was a scoundrel!\\n\\n\"And I... I will never let that prediction come to pass!\"\\n\\nThe girl admired everything about her master as a diviner — his intelligence, skills, and integrity. However, she could not accept how he willingly sank into the blinding abyss of fatalism and regarded it as an acceptable way of life, despite being a diviner who could peek into destiny.\\n\\nTherefore, Fu Xuan ran away from the Xianzhou Yuque despite her family's dissuasion and the hurdles she had to cross. She ran away like a self-exiled escapee, plunging into the Luofu's Divination Commission with its more unrestricted culture and devoted herself to calculations. Not only did she want to part from the Xianzhou Yuque, she also wanted to prove with her own hands that her teacher's prediction was nothing but his own ludicrous delusions.", "5": "Centuries passed thus, and the flames of war descended again. Diviner Fu Xuan calculated ceaselessly at her job. The grand armies of the Denizens of Abundance formed for the third time and launched a surprise attack on the Xianzhou Fanghu. The Yuque and the Luofu were close to the Fanghu, and it was their duty to give assistance. The divination revealed that all Xianzhou armies will meet a devastating defeat if they choose to face the assault head-on — however, should they keep up a defense, then there will be a chance to change the tides of battle.\\n\\nWhat a pity that the hexagram did not reveal how this chance will come about! Fu Xuan calculated and divined over and over again, yet the results given by the Matrix of Prescience never changed.\\n\\n\"No one will choose defeat.\" This was the limit of a diviner's capacities. Fu Xuan outlined the pros and cons in writing and submitted the divination results to the Seat of Divine Foresight. However, as she expected, the outcome of the meeting between the Arbiter-Generals concluded that they must not take on a defensive position, not when such overwhelming numbers of the Abundance Axis were assaulting the Fanghu. The Cloud Knights of the Luofu and the Yuque must rise to face the enemy, buying time before the Yaoqing's army can arrive.\\n\\nOn that day, Fu Xuan bore witness through the Projection Sandpit to the Alliance's army being decimated. Not only did the borisin bring fleets and mechabeasts numerous enough to block out the sky, they even summoned the incarnosphere Ketu Mirage from ancient legends. This evil gravitated toward the Fanghu, hellbent on bringing annihilation to all lives onboard, recreating the tragedy of the fall of the Xianzhou Cangcheng. And the only thing people could do was watch as it neared.\\n\\nWas this truly the limit of a diviner's capacities!? A bold idea surfaced in Fu Xuan's mind as she drowned in anxiety and anger. \"I must see General Jing Yuan!\"\\n\\nThe girl spoke her thoughts when brought face-to-face with the general. It was no longer possible to obtain victory with the forces available to the Cloud Knights. The only chance of victory lies in making the Reignbow manifest themselves.\\n\\nShe was not expecting the tired-looking man before her to simply nod after hearing her absurd and borderline blasphemous idea. The general did not even show any hints of ridicule. \"How would you want to do it?\"\\n\\n\"The Xianzhou Yuque holds the Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance. Not only can it scry into the distance, it can also be used to send out information... I plan to ship the Cloudpeer Telescope to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger, and send out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow. If we hurry, we still have a chance to turn everything around before that living planet falls.\"\\n\\n\"I trust that you are... well aware of the singular sign of the Reignbow's descent onto the physical plane and its consequences, correct?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. As the person who voiced this plan, I am willing to be on the front lines and execute it.\" The girl's expression was solemn. She was keenly aware of how unorthodox her idea was.\\n\\n\"I thank you for your words, but the Six Charioteers should work together to combat such a great crisis. Moreover, you do not have the permission to manipulate that device. Should this plan go awry, I will take all responsibility as the one who made the suggestion. Do not trouble yourself over this, Miss Fu.\"\\n\\nAs Fu Xuan watched the general's retreating figure, she suddenly realized what he meant by \"the Six Charioteers should work together\" — the only person who has the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and can send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree...\\n\\n...was none other than the Yuque's Master Diviner.\\n\\n...\\n\\n\"Is this why you seek \"The Eye\"? I saw your dreams...\"\\n\\nThe girl did not open her eyes, yet she could already see the world around her condense into solid form from nebulous mist, see all possibilities fade and leave behind the solitary, absolute, and faultless \"choice.\"\\n\\n\"Those are not dreams. They are my past. They made me who I am.\"\\n\"And he was right all this time. There is only ever one path in destiny.\""}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Novaburst", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 25% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 30% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 35% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 40% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 45% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 50% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 55% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 60% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Quantum DMG equal to 65% of Fu Xuan's Max HP to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Quantum DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Known by Stars, Shown by Hearts", "SkillTag": "Defense", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Activates Matrix of Prescience, via which other team members will Distribute 65% of the DMG they receive (before this DMG is mitigated by any Shields) to Fu Xuan for 3 turn(s).\\nWhile affected by Matrix of Prescience, all team members gain the Knowledge effect, which increases their respective Max HP by 3% of Fu Xuan's Max HP, and increases CRIT Rate by 6%.\\nWhen Fu Xuan is knocked down, the Matrix of Prescience will be dispelled.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Activates Matrix of Prescience.

Retainer to General Jing Yuan. Collector of antique swords from the Artisanship Commission... With all these auspicious titles and street gossip swirling around this one wunderkind, it's scarcely believable that he is still a child.\\n\\nEver since he could remember, Yanqing would follow Jing Yuan around like a shadow, helping the Seat of Divine Foresight resolve problems. And Jing Yuan in return taught him the art of swordplay — and the art of war. After years of training, Yanqing's mind is as quick and sharp as the spotless sword he keeps.\\n\\nCloud Knight combat drills attest that controlling six simultaneous flying daggers is something even Cloud Knight chief drillmasters can't master in a century. The phrase agreed among the Xianzhou people to describe the combat talents of Yanqing is \"A gifted swordsman born to fight.\"", "3": "It's recorded in the military annals of the Cloud Knights how Jing Yuan came to discover the young boy, stood his ground against public opinion, and incorporated him into the armed forces. However, in the family lineage column, Yanqing's lineage was relegated to the category of unknown.\\n\\nMost talented officers display military talent from childhood. For millennia, several talented unicorns have emerged ahead of the pack during the hunt. However, Yanqing earned a military commission before he even reached the age of majority. Some would criticize that \"the general is absurd\" on this matter.\\n\\nHowever, this genius' debut on the battlefield was even more explosive, and any critical voices soon fell silent.\\n\\nWhen hunting near a distant star, the monstrously huge mechabeast Windguard created by the Denizens of Abundance was pulverizing defense forces as though they were ants. But this young boy met against it face-to-face, claiming its head and routing the enemy to the point of collapse.\\n\\nAs for subsequent victories: He broke the borisin's Devouring Wolf formation with Jing Yuan, beheading three Brood Lords. He also fought viciously against the wingweavers, ultimately sinking their almighty Cloudseizer Fleet... These are just a small footnote in the annals of his courageous swordplay.", "4": "If you ask Yanqing what other interests he has besides sword fighting, you'll be met with a simple answer —\\n\\n\"Interests would only affect the speed of my sword!\"\\n\\nLike a child infatuated with toys, he spares no expense in buying most of the blades manufactured by the Artisanship Commission — flying swords controlled by qi, daggers for close combat, flexible swords that can bend and adjust... He knows different sword's spec and function like the back of his mind. He'll even buy an extra copy — one to use in combat, and one for his collection. This leaves his finances in a sorrowful situation at the end of each month, where he could only beg the general for food and daily necessities.\\n\\nIt's completely natural for teenage boys to love swords, but a specific dream flickers and dances among the Xianzhou swords in his collection.\\n\\nTo become the best on the Luofu — no, the best across all the Xianzhou ships. To take the title of Sword Champion on the Luofu, and even take the title of Sword Preeminence across the Alliance.\\n\\nSince the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the title of Sword Champion among the Luofu Cloud Knights has remained vacant for centuries. Not that nobody wants to claim it, but for a rather more embarrassing reason:\\n\\nThe previous Sword Champion, a legendary swordmaster with 13 outstanding accolades, violated the laws of heaven and resulting in her name being wiped from the face of the cosmos. Even the prestigious title that she bore became a sore spot for others.\\n\\nBut for this vastly impressive teen, it's now time to turn over a new page in the annals of history and write another chapter.", "5": "\"Bout #123: Yanqing, Jing Yuan.\"\\n\"General, let's call it a day! I'm exhausted...\"\\n\"Didn't you say you have the confidence to remain undefeated as long as you hold a sword?

What if I accidentally hurt...\"\\n\"If your sword is half as quick as you mouth, I'd already have lost. I'll keep one hand behind my back. Now, be quick!\"\\n\"No no, two hands please! Or maybe you can consider not using the Lightning-Lord, general?\"\\n\"You think is like the Sky-Faring Commission's business, where you can barter your way out? Hmm, let me see...\"\\n\"Aha — a weakness! Watch this!\"\\n\"I knew you'd do that. Counter!\"\\n\"Ow-ow-ow, darn it! I'd been waiting for ages for my shot.\"\\n\"All's equal in war, and sneak attacks are a good idea. It's too bad your sword is so focused on the flourish and can't conceal its form. Is this what they call youthful vigor?\"\\n\"General, let's go again! This time I'll try to be as inconspicuous as possible...\"\\n\\nJing Yuan spent much time and energy in raising Yanqing. Some speculated that he was cultivating an heir, others claimed he only kept him around just to use this kid as a secret weapon. Jing Yuan never offered a response.\\n\\nYanqing became an unrivaled fighter aboard the Xianzhou Luofu as his skills grew more and more advanced. Jing Yuan gradually began thinking about ways to restrain Yanqing's edge, to take him down a peg without curbing his confidence.\\n\\nToo solid and it can shatter. Too sharp and it can blunt. More than just a sharp edge — a sword also needs a scabbard that can restrain it. In Jing Yuan's view, Yanqing has grown up exceedingly fast — beyond expectations. What Yanqing needs right now is not more strength, but the ability and experience of curbing that strength — something that can only manifest by the passage of time."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Frost

However, time did not seem to leave any traces on its stones. As if it stood apart from the rules of time and space, it forever protected this family in eternal peace and joy.\\n\\nHer father trained Guinevere's eldest brother, second-eldest brother, and eldest sister in politics. He wished to hand the future of this planet to one of the three. As for Guinevere and her younger siblings... He only wished they would have a quiet and happy life in this tranquil paradise.\\n\\nGuinevere loved her father. He was as terrifying as a ridge-tailed python when facing his political enemies. Yet in her presence, he softened and became warm and cozy, like a big fuzzy mountain hare.\\n\\nShe remembered that her father would do anything for her. He would even willingly play the role of an earth spirit to be struck down by Guinevere, the heroine, at her birthday party. The birthday parties of upper-class children would often have the family's enemies turn up as well — However, her father didn't care at all about being a laughingstock for all the attendees. He was happy as long as she could be happy.\\n\\nThen, Guinevere grew up a bit. She started to hear rumors — How her father made the king a puppet, persecuted the honest courtiers, and gluttonously gained riches... She was willing to believe that all these were lies spread by his enemies. However, she knew not all of them were lies.\\n\\nSoon, however, these concerns ceased to matter.\\n\\nEverything changed when the Antimatter Legion attacked. Her father led the army to protect the royal capital, refusing to back down. Guinevere fainted when she heard the news of his death. She was already sitting inside a space shuttle when she woke up again. Her younger siblings were sobbing next to her, while her eldest brother and eldest sister were bound tightly in ropes. Her second-eldest brother said to her in a despondent tone, \"Don't untie them just yet. They are still trying to go back.\"\\n\\nGuinevere looked outside the window. Her mother was dressed in armor and had her back turned to the space shuttle slowly lifting off, taking command of servants who were still willing to fight. Further away, the Voidrangers were tearing apart the Lord Protector's mansion. Even further, entire streets were on fire, with charred corpses scattered everywhere like heaps of soil.\\n\\nFor little Guinevere, it was like her entire world had been erased from the cosmos.\\n\\n...\\n\\nMy home world, Court Camelot. My siblings, a dozen lot.\\nOur days, peace and joy to boot. Until Ruin Author led woes afoot.\\nNation breached, arms they took. Legion marched, defiant we stood.\\nWe siblings escaped without a root, into an IPC mine all covered in soot.\\nMeager scraps are what we fetch, homeless and foodless at a stretch.\\nEldest brother, timid once was. Back-breaking work, to piracy he was forced.\\nMercantile he waylaid, genteel he relayed. Hero among bandits, loots for people's benefits.\\nHundreds of poor he led, us siblings he fed.\\n\\n...", "4": "When Guinevere was young, her father always told her that humans should live with dignity.

Among the endemic species that stubbornly proliferated in that world, almost all of them existed as genuine threats to humanity.\\n\\nHad the Interastral Peace Corporation not discovered the mineral ores hidden in the heart of this planet, no humans would have wanted to move here anyways.\\n\\nGuinevere passed all of her teenage years on this poverty-stricken planet.\\n\\nShe was good at making friends and was on good terms with the other kids. The son of the poor man, the daughter of the refugee, the brother of the gambler, or the sister of the murderer... Guinevere did not care about people's background. No matter what kind of families people are from, they were equally at risk of perishing before the arrival of tomorrow on this planet.\\n\\nThe IPC didn't keep a tight eye on this place. Except for those with debts or criminal charges, the IPC didn't limit the workers' freedom as long as they paid their taxes. However, if they did pay their taxes, they might not have enough money left to even buy a drink at the town's bar.\\n\\nHer father was the most reliable backbone of the family back home. Now that both father and home were lost, the duty of looking after the family fell on the shoulders of the only senior in the group — the Stone-Wall Knight. Back when they had to flee their home, the mother sternly demanded that this loyal old knight escape with the children, while she stayed behind in their homeland to watch over the last speck of dust on their barren planet.\\n\\nThe old knight was once her father's closest playmate, then her father's most courageous comrade in battle, then her father's most loyal servant. And now... he became another \"father\" for the children. Guinevere didn't manage to remember his real name even till the end. She was more familiar with the knight's other name — Uncle Stone-Wall.\\n\\nA dozen starving children made their dwindling finances even worse. After a night of arguments, Stone-Wall reluctantly agreed to have the three eldest children go to work in the mines with him. However, no matter how much Guinevere begged, he refused to let her go with them.\\n\\nNight after night passed. Stone-Well grew old and withered. His lungs became full of incurable scars, and his spine no longer stood as tall as in years past. His hands, once able to swing a kinetic hammer majestically on the battlefield, have been deformed till he could no longer hold a spoon.\\n\\nSoon, he died.\\n\\nThe stone wall fell. It fell before the dawn arrived, and it didn't make a single sound. It was like a sand castle receding as the tides swelled and fell, like the soft descent of winter's withered boughs in a breeze, like an ending doomed to arrive.\\n\\nOnly a world of hoarfrost exists beyond the stone wall.\\n\\nHer elder brothers soon became interstellar pirates. Guinevere can fill her stomach again. However, she was also faintly aware that she had further strayed from her father's creed and embarked on a life even less respectable.\\n\\nTherefore, when the IPC's soldiers put cuffs on Guinevere and handed her over to the Cloud Knights together with her younger siblings, she breathed a long sigh of relief.\\n\\nPeople all claim the folks of the Xianzhou are very kind. She thought that the Cloud Knights would definitely allow her entire family to die together in dignity.\\n\\n...\\n\\nFolly befell my brother's mind. A Xianzhou ship, his raid entwined\\nThose of Xianzhou, just and upright. Thunder and storm, willed in their might.\\nTo Xianzhou, my brother offered compliance. For us siblings, he pleaded forbearance.\\nXianzhou knights, blessed with grace. Xianzhou fleet, we get to embrace.\\nOur brother pardoned, our burdens lessened.\\nTo the school, our young'uns go. Teaching skills was my dear Ms. Yo.\\nA future elsewhere, brother urged me to prepare. Gratitude to pay, I chose here to stay.\\nIn Aurum Alley I shine. Fame and fortune, I'm fine.\\n\\n...", "5": "\"Sorry, sorry! I ran into someone who was injured, so I got here later than I thought — Ah. Little Gui, you're still singing? Then I'll shut up.\"\\n\\n\"Yo! Shangshang is here! Fam, lemme introduce her to y'all. She's our surprise guest tonight! The Cloud Knights' genius newcomer — Ms. Sushang!

Nice! Let's all give it up for Little Gui, everyone! But... I don't quite remember this heroic feat?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Xiyan told me that stories featuring damsel-in-distress scenarios are popular, hence my decision to write it this way.

The stuff you do are all fun anyways.\"\\n\\n\"Alrighty. Now that Shang-Shang is here, let's do the Show-Show! We can now finally present the duo skit we've been practicing for a long time~ Here, Shangshang, gimme the chordophone. I, Little Gui, is now gonna sing Teng Xiao Slaying the Serpent!\"\\n\\n\"This section isn't easy to perform.\"\\n\\n\"True. Any expert here would know that Teng Xiao Slaying the Serpent has singing, music, and fight scenes. One person can't do it all.\"\\n\\n\"And that is why I'm here! So how do you want to do this?\"\\n\\n\"Simple~ Today I'm gonna play the role of Teng Xiao, the previous Luofu general. I'll bring peace to the nation and all shall bow before my majesty.\"\\n\\n\"And me?\"\\n\\n\"You'll play the serpent getting slain! Where are you going, puny snake? Take~ My~ Sword~\"\\n\\n\"Ahh!

She has not grown. This is not unusual as slow development is common among Vidyadhara. I am more concerned about her having no dreams than the slow growth of her body.\\n\\nAll past high elders, after receiving the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" will re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is after all the only way our kind have of coming close to Permanence. Yet Lady Bailu has experienced nothing of this sort. It is apparent that either her dragon heart is in some way damaged, or the \"Transmutation Arcanum\" has not been carried through in full.\\n\\nFurthermore, since the high elder has already demonstrated her powers of calling lightning and commanding the waters, I have instructed one of our finest crafters to make the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle her tail, to prevent a loss of control over her powers and a repeat of the disaster of the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.\\n\\nAlso, we received a missive from Caelorum Venti of the Yaoqing some months ago, inquiring into the present condition of Lady Bailu. I have replied as you instructed, esteemed elders. The gist of my reply was that Lady Bailu is still young and in need of the assistance of the Preceptors. Only after her coming-of-age ceremony will the Preceptors confer the title of Imbibitor Lunae on her.\\n\\nRespectfully yours, Yunyou, attendant to the High Elder."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Diagnostic Kick", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 50% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 60% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 70% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 80% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 90% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 1% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 110% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 120% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Lightning DMG equal to 130% of Bailu's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Lightning DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Singing Among Clouds", "SkillTag": "Restore", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Heals a single ally for 8% of Bailu's Max HP plus 78.

However, the songs and gestures were mere facades. The light emanating from his eyes and the storm roiling in his blood were the true forces at play. Casually, he wove the misty and foggy tide in Scalegorge Waterscape, sealing the maddened and frenzied \"dragon\" into the propagating giant tree. As the echoing roar streamed up into the heavens and dissipated, Scalegorge Waterscape will continue its peace for centuries more, and his duty was over.\\n\\nThe ceremony ended, and he turned to look behind him. In the blink of an eye, the stairs he had stepped down from had become full of standing dignitaries with draconic horns and dressed like royalty. As if they were mirages in a mirror, each of them turned and their sleeves swirled with the motion, ready to leave one after another in a meticulously calculated arrangement. Innumerable, they formed a staircase to the sky, stretching into the never-ending spatial void. The faces of all these people would greet him every morning in his dressing mirror — That was his face.\\n\\nNo, it was the face of the primordial, the original, the very first high elder. He smiled bitterly and covered his face with his palm, as if ascertaining whether he could tear off this mask and return it to its true owner.\\n\\nHe could not.", "3": "In the dim abyss devoid of light, he seemed to have returned to the insides of a Vidyadhara egg, being ceaselessly churned in tumultuous waves and elusive dreams.\\n\\nHe dreamed he arrived at the battlefield like the descent of a god. He hovered with the clouds — the military formations below him were tiny as ants, and the airborne chariots and starskiffs were moths destined to die in a flame. Such were the lives of mortals... Was this the viewpoint of a dragon? A sliver of hubris rose up and plunged his heart into emotionless and icy detachment, and he hurriedly cast his gaze toward those with whom he had fought and shared liquor:\\n\\nThe pilot who zoomed past did not care whether the formation was orderly. She shot at will, letting the arrows filled with blazing fire fall on the storming borisin foot soldiers...\\n\\nAlong the direction pointed out by the starskiffs, a white-haired swordswoman spearheaded into the fray ahead of the entire army, dancing with her sharp blade. She dashed between flashes of metallic light, her actions too sharp to even let her allies come near, reducing them to merely supporting her from behind...\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Cloud Knight Lieutenant who used to chat and laugh with the dragon contained his languid indolence, holding his devastator glaive in hand as he stood with his men to repel the borisin pawns attacking from the battlefield's wings...\\n\\nAnd behind the main host, the military engineers who marched with the army were adjusting and testing giant aurumatons... perhaps that exceedingly arrogant craftsman was now working at full speed, for these machines hundreds of feet tall are specialized weapons designed to counter the mechabeasts...\\n\\nThen, he saw the general of yesteryear, Teng Xiao. He was enveloped in golden lightning like the avatar of the Reignbow, plowing through the enemies' rows of war beasts with his divine mirage...\\n\\nThe devastated borisins began to flee. He knew it was time to carry out the duty entrusted to him. So he let go — letting his consciousness disappear in storms and hails, letting thunder roar for him, letting tsunamis rage for him. He floated on top of clouds, watching the enemies getting swallowed by the watery abyss, and watching the land behind him. Many humans, Vidyadhara, and Foxians were eternally left there, unable to lay their eyes upon their home ever again.\\n\\nThe dragon heart told him that it was but a small speck of dust brushed away from the world. Wars come with a price, but life will always thrive once more — the Vidyadhara are not the only branch of Long's Scions. However, his human heart ached for those comrades who, like him, had warm flesh and blood, and for those mortals who might have lived longer but now could return home nevermore.", "4": "In the dim abyss devoid of light, he seemed to have returned to the insides of a Vidyadhara egg, being ceaselessly churned in tumultuous waves and elusive dreams.\\n\\nHe dreamed that he parted the ocean's waters and came to the palace ruin depths, burying the remnants of his old friend's hallowed blood, or creating a new life that had not been seen for millennia — or, perhaps, those two actions were one and the same, an unattainable desire that could not be carried out for long years in the past, a final straw that broke the gargantuan dragon's back. The craftsman was covered in blood and wounds as he guarded the dragon with a sword in his hand. He urged himself to commit to the decision.\\n\\n\"Shuhu is dead... we won, but how many more victories can we manage to achieve? How many more prices like this must we pay?\"\\n\"Look, the Ambrosial Arbor still stands. So long as it is alive, the monsters... they can come back again and again. The war of the Xianzhou natives, Foxians, and Vidyadhara against the abominations will never end.\"\\n\"Yes, none of us are special! Each of us has only one life, sacrificing for this, dying for that... it's all our own choices. Just like how she chose to save you and Jingliu... just like how she chose to let more people live on!\"\\n\\nWar, and the lives that expired in the war, were living beings just like him.\\nHe shut his eyes wearily, remembering their faces, and made up his mind.\\n\"If there's a chance... we will also choose to let her and more people live on.\\nWe, the Vidyadhara, have our own way of salvation. I can give it a try.\"\\n\\nLike an out-of-body experience, like a dream within a dream, he returned to the moment before his sense of self disappeared. With a cold and emotionless mind, he observed himself turning into a dragon, entangled and fighting claw-and-fangs against that bulb of shapeshifting shadow of flesh and blood. In an illusion seen on the verge of death, the emissary of the god showed him an unsettling, beautiful scene — the stars pulsated and sang hymns like red blood cells, and the universe descended into an abyss of flesh and desires. The dragon heart beat to its limit, raising its fangs, breath, and fury — however, no matter how mighty it was, a \"lifeform\" cannot defy the true body of god of life's envoy.\\n\\n...Until a starskiff ran everything through like an arrow shaft. He saw that girl crawling out of the ruins with great difficulty, lifting a \"sun\" of absolute darkness in her hand. In that fleeting eternity, he saw her hand disappear, saw her face disappear, and saw HER disappear — That item had ground everything around it into the finest dust and dragged them into a vortex of raw power, including that girl.\\n\\nA tuft of hair and a few drops of blood fell to the floor as evidence of her existence. Those were the only traces she left.", "5": "In the dim abyss devoid of light, he seemed to have returned to the insides of a Vidyadhara egg, being ceaselessly churned in tumultuous waves and elusive dreams.\\n\\nHe dreamed of the Dracocatena Nails being staked into his body, and chains of corallium winding around him to hang him in midair in the Shackling Prison. He dreamed the elders coming and going to interrogate him about the truth of the Arcanum and the whereabouts of the dragon heart. He did not speak.\\n\\nHe dreamed of the Judges coming before him to read their decision and wanting to sentence him to death. He did not speak.\\n\\nHe dreamed of the white-haired Cloud Knight Lieutenant coming to visit him and bringing him news of the Lieutenant's negotiations. The Vidyadhara did not permit him to die, nor did they permit him to leave. He did not speak.\\n\\nHe dreamed he was raising his cup to drink with the others again, that he molted off his scales, and that he returned to the egg, and became someone else.\\n\\nHe dreamed many, many things, like a never-ending immersia entitled \"Self.\"\\n\\nFollowing the immersia was an even clearer but unreachable illusion.\\n\\nHe saw himself being exiled. He saw himself boarding an express. He saw himself running into the endless stars, never looking back."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Beneficent Lotus", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 50% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 60% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 70% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 80% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 90% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 1% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 110% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 120% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Uses a 2-hit attack and deals Imaginary DMG equal to 130% of Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae's ATK to a single enemy target.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Dracore Libre", "SkillTag": "Enhance", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Enhances Basic ATK.

She is in charge of \"detention\" among the four judges of detention, interrogation, incarceration, and punishment.\\nWith iron chain and Mara-Sunder Awl in hand in tireless pursuit of recidivists, she will forthwith ensnare and subdue them all.\\nThe mortal coil of her past being has been reduced to ashes. She is reanimated via a puppet body. For each villain she captures, she gets in return half a day in the world of the living.", "2": "\"Ten Lords perceptual, Karma perpetual.\"\\n\\nDressed as white as the driven snow, the Judge strolled out from the dim street, obscuring his final escape.\\n\\nThe man drew closer, but the shrill tremble in his voice betrayed his fear: \"How... is catching them not enough?\"\\n\\nIt may have started with a \"How,\" but not as a question, rather as a rhetorical one. The semantic analysis goes back and forth in the mind, and there's no other intel other than \"the target clearly knew who the accomplice was.\"\\n\\nShe decided to execute the mission assigned to her straight away.\\n\\nThe eyeballs, forehead, chin, heart, the Core Esse, and the lower abdomen... With a glance, she marked off all the parts that might make for a single effective strike. Despite Foxians being known for their quick reactions, her opponent had left himself wide open and one round... two rounds, max, should be enough to take care of things.\\n\\nBut this blow missed.\\n\\nThe Judge looked at him with an air of curiosity. The man's body seemed to move like scurrying mice, with muscles undulating, and his eyes sparkled with the gleam of a well-executed plan.\\n\\nHe panted violently as though suffering from a critical illness, and during a burst of uncontrollable pain his body shot out large swathes of fine hairs as his limbs and body swelled and tore open by some invisible force. Under the glow of moonlight within the delve, a monstrous wolfman stood up. In the view of the Judge, the sanguine silhouette enveloping its body had burned up into a wildfire.\\n\\n\"You... are seeking death.\" She has an urge to sigh out of habit, but her body no longer has that function. \"The partaking of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus' concoction will only hasten your demise.\"\\n\\nThe man's gaze barely wavers at all. \"The second I was discovered by you, I only ever had a few more days to live.\"\\n\\nThe Foxian grabs the medicine pouch, and pours out more pills into his mouth as though it were candy. \"You are a tool that sheds no blood and cry no tears. You could never understand — I have my reason for leaving here!\"\\n\\nA huge fist suddenly expanded, filling up the entire field of vision, and the Judge barely had any time to react. Shaking her arms, the chain she clutched whipped into a circle as she tried to lasso the fist.\\n\\nThe fist punched into her chest with astonishing force, splitting cracks into the ground like cobwebs and creating a crater beneath where the white-robed Judge was standing.\\n\\nThere was no pain, only the gentle ringing of damaged ingenium parts. The white-robed Judge was left befuddled.", "3": "\"Madam Xueyi, this body of yours is beyond salvation. I... I have to move you into a new puppet now. This process may leave you a little confused. Please bear with me.\"\\n\\nSimilar conversations had been exchanged between her and Huohuo the spiritfarer over and over again. She responded the same as always, \"Thank you. This time, please pick something sturdy.\"\\n\\nShe saw Huohuo's foxy ear twitch — was it out of frustration? She knew not. Her eyes could see, but they had no capacity for recognizing emotion... And maybe this was through no fault of her eyes.\\n\\n\"I've packed all the best, hardest, and most flexible parts into Madam Xueyi's body, but your rates of injury and damage are still the highest in the division... The craftsmen of the Interrogation Division have started to grumble.\"\\n\\n\"Once you put me together, I will...\"\\n\\n\"... Just give each of them a 'light' tap on the head, okay?\" A familiar voice came beside her as she lay at sixes and sevens.\"They are still flesh and blood, and cannot stand your jokes.\"\\n\\nLong hair drooped down to cover her face, and a disturbance signal emitted from her artificial skin. The woman's face looking down had each independent feature combined into a new one that was both extremely familiar yet also kind to her.\\n\\n\"Sister, having an ingenium body will always lull you into a false sense of invulnerability. However, I have to use the remaining days of reanimation to offset premature damage to this body of yours. I hope you can remember during your next mission that you've still got a sister out there who cares about you.\"\\n\\n\"I remember.\"\\n\\n\"Otherwise, you'll have to get Huohuo to write this line into your mind... Ah, just kidding, Huohuo. No need for that. I trust my sister can remember it.\"\\n\\n\"So Madam Xueyi, let's begin.\"\\n\\nShe felt herself being sliced open, copied, split into a thousand pieces, and uploaded into millions of circuits housed at the Ten-Lords Commission. When...\\nIn a flash, she shuffled through countless documents inscribed in the Hall of Karma and then, after a fleeting glimpse at all the souls of the Xianzhou, the memory vanished.\\nMoments later, she entered the body of a nearby aurumaton spectral envoy, feeling both the strength of the metal body alongside the unshakable will of the jade abacus.\\nShe has one thousand pairs of eyes, watching over the people of Starskiff Haven with the wings and sight line of a cycrane...\\nShe has one thousand ears, scanning the changing waves and pitches among the infinite possible frequencies...\\nHer one thousand hands write handwritten judgments on the spiritfarer's body, and her one thousand feet give chase over unfamiliar avenues... \\nShe knows that she's only inside the jade abacus circuitry of the Ten-Lords Commission, but she feels as though she were everywhere and gradually fading away...\\n\\n\"Sister... sister!\"\\n\\nA familiar voice rang out again beyond the waveform of the voiceprint, and she was trapped fast inside a memory. The white-robed judge was left befuddled.", "4": "\"Sister... sister!\"\\n\\nShe was shocked to discover herself beneath an azure sky, surrounded by lush undulating waves of wheat growing.\\n\\nShe smiled as she braided together the twigs and flowers she'd picked up earlier, placing this wreath on the tiny head of the little girl in her lap. The girl turned back to look at her, smiling even more brightly than the flowers.\\n\\nShe held onto this face tightly, vowing to eternally protect this delicate, fragile face — vowing to do many, many things for her.\\n\\n\"Sister... sister!\"\\n\\nAs soon as she was distracted, this face relaxed and grew broader. There was no trace of weakness in those gorgeous eyes that needed her care — only perseverance. This face once walked side-by-side with her, boarding starskiffs together and cruising out beyond the borders.\\n\\nSandstorms, frost, mud marks... Time has left behind much dirt upon this face. But these hands will always gently and meticulously wipe away everything.\\n\\nJust like herself, her sister has grown and matured. She shouldn't always wipe her sister's face clean in front of everyone like an anxious mother. But how could she ever just let go of things? She vowed to protect this face forever — vowing to do many, many things.\\n\\n\"Sister... sister!\"\\n\\nShe looked up from the blood and fire of the scorched earth. On the ground lay thousands of familiar but lifeless faces, including that of her sister.\\n\\nBut she couldn't find her own face.\\n\\n\"I can save her. I can save all of you. All it takes is a wave of the branch and I can teach flesh to regrow from the mere bones or let petals rise up out of the dust to the flower once more. You know very well I can.\"\\n\\nUnderneath her, a strange tree with a thousand faces spoke to her, and to everyone. They waved their branches, penetrating deep into the earth.\\n\\n\"I am Shuhu. I am eternal. From me, you shall gain true immortality.\"\\n\\nSobbing, she closed her eyes, incapable of providing any resistance. At this moment, she was just an insignificant fruit upon this giant tree, powerless against mighty roots.\\n\\nA colossal, blazing sword plunged down from the heavens, scorching away the sweet yet putrid atmosphere. A towering figure in formidable armor crashed onto the battlefield like a meteor, bellowing at the towering tree. The strange tree blossomed once more like a perennial flower, its golden branches growing ferociously to tightly entangle the enemy.\\n\\n\"Each time you overcome death, I am beyond overjoyed. Like them, your flesh and blood are insignificant, but your pain is something that pleases me.\"\\n\\nThe branches laughed shrilly, letting each head speak one word on their behalf, stringing together a sentence, \"Teng Xiao, what do you plan on using to kill me this time? I'm curious.\"\\n\\n\"With myself.\" The man replies calmly. Behind him, the golden illusion plunges the colossal blade straight down into the ground from high up in the sky.\\n\\n\"Sister... sister!\"\\n\\nThe cries grow more urgent. She could feel herself being once again filtered, deleted, merged, and stuffed into a narrow and limited self.\\n\\n\"These so-called Judges of the Netherworld and envoys of the Ten Lords truly amount to nothing.\"\\n\\nLike everyone who jolts awake from a dream, she returns to her body but has forgotten the momentary dream. The judge dressed in white feels befuddled.", "5": "The raspy laughter of the Foxian next to the judge's ears sounds like the howling of a wolf.\\n\\nThe man took away dozens of the most valuable pellets in the organization. Now, it appears that he is simply lacking in combat experience. Ingesting just one pellet is already enough to easily crush the judge before him.\\n\\n\"At the end, ingenia have their limits... They are nothing compared to the immeasurable potential of the bodies of us long-life species.\"\\n\\nThe Foxian chuckles and tries to retrieve his arm, only to find several chains entangling it. The chains are interlocked and intertwined over his skin like spider silk.\\n\\nThe judge's eyes are glowing through the gaps in her long black hair, which cascades down her face. Her expression reminds the Foxian of a predator that had smelled blood. \"My ingenium organ, 'Deities of the Five Organ Senses,' has been damaged. The part responsible for my sympathy has been reduced.\"\\n\\n\"...That's ridiculous!\" As the Foxian curls his fingers into the shape of a claw and powerfully slams it down, a three-pronged spike pierces through his palm. He shrieks in pain.\\n\\n\"I originally wanted to let you undergo interrogation in the Shackling Prison with your body intact, but you have shattered my sympathy.\"\\n\\n\"Just drop your act! Have you forgotten that I'm tied to you through your chain?\" The wounded beast caught in the trap starts struggling. The Foxian pulls the chain and drags the white-robed judge into his arms. Every inch of his massive muscles contracts like coiled ropes in response to his anger. The unsettling sound of bones sliding out of their sockets and becoming misaligned pops loudly in the air.\\n\\n\"Just like how you put it, body of flesh and blood holds unfathomable potential... But it has a crucial setback. It feels pain.\"\\n\\nThe white-robed judge's voice hums as the man's agonizing screams resonate in the night sky.\\n\\nShe props her shattered right arm up. Her broken iron bone protrudes out like the sharp tip of a spear, stabbing into the Foxian's jaw that already appears like a wolf's. The twisted fugitive scrambles in all directions but fails to break free from the judge's relentless pursuit. He rolls around on the ground in excruciating pain, finally losing consciousness and going limp like a puddle of goo.\\n\\n\"You say I am a tool that sheds no blood and cries no tears?\" The judge, now dressed in a bloodstained robe, slowly rises from the massive body of the criminal. \"It's Abominations of Abundance like you... that have shattered my sympathy.\"\\n\\nShe tries her best to push her skull, spine, and patella back to the correct positions, then fastens to her waist the severed arm that cannot be re-attached no matter what.\\n\\nWhat will her sister and Huohuo say about this time? A habit slumbering deep in her mind makes her want to heave a sigh, but her body no longer has that function."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Mara-Sunder Awl", "SkillTag": "Single Target",

Waves of anger, longing, hatred, fear, and exhaustion crash upon her like colorless surges, propelling her from one turbulent realm to another.\\n\\nLike a drowned soul, she finally lets go of her individuality and dissolves into the boundless ocean of chaos...\\n\\nThere was a time when she held the role of an officer in the Realm-Keeping Commission, constantly dealing with mountains of mundane duties, yearning for a promotion. Eventually, after a sharp snap that echoed deep within her mind, she started wandering the streets like a mindless corpse...\\n\\nIn the next moment, burdened with immeasurable grief, she submerged her baby with birth defects in a vessel brimming with starskiff culture medium, despite her and her husband's eager anticipation for their newborn baby...\\n\\nOnce a Cloud Knight, she was ruthlessly struck down by a wolf's twisted paw, her face maimed by its sharp claws, carving a twisted \"smile.\" Whenever she smiled, the wound induced excruciating pain in the years that followed...\\n\\nHer divination revealed that her life teetered on the verge of oblivion. In despair, she overhauled the Matrix of Prescience's calculation terminal, attempting to access its core to utilize its full power. However, the Matrix's power ravaged her mind mercilessly...\\n\\nShe smashed her meticulously crafted contraption, as well as the foreman who had intentionally made things difficult for her. At that moment, she realized she would never achieve her dream of becoming a craftsman, but what else could she do...?\\n\\nShe became every one of them, all of them. Yet, at that moment, like an ink droplet descending upon her vision, an image swirled and dissipated.\\n\\nBeneath azure skies, undulating waves of wheat surged and seethed around her. A nimble pair of hands gently crowned her head with a wreath. She allowed the foliage, leaves, and fragrant blooms to encircle her, just as the tender hands had embraced her...\\n\\nThat familiar warmth jolts her from the deluge poised to consume everything.\\n\\nShe realizes that she is not any of them, nor the sum of their forms. In that fleeting instant, she dwindles into a minuscule droplet within the ocean of consciousness. She recalls her name and her duty...\\n\\nShe is a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, bearing the code name, \"Hanya.\"\\n\\nObserving her awakening, the aurumaton stationed beside the coffin commenced a rapid flurry of writing, its movements too swift for the naked eye to discern.\\n\\nThe verdict of her judgment has been revealed, and the names that materialized within her dreams are transcribed onto a jade abacus token. As twilight melds into night within the delve, countless souls will bid their final farewell to the mortal realm, unaware that the precise moment of their demise had been recorded by someone within the innermost recesses of the Xianzhou ship. And within a few hours, the woman will no longer retain any recollection of them.", "3": "On the opposite side of the coffin, a white-robed judge stared at her with an unwavering gaze. In the absence of smiles, that once familiar face now looked particularly alien. The judge extended their hand, and a golden jug sat in their palm.\\n\\nEnclosed within the jug is a liquor as green as jade, an emerald eye that glares unblinkingly at her within the dark vaults of the Hall of Karma.\\n\\n\"Is it time to drink again? I almost forgot.\" She rose from the coffin. \"Why are you bringing me the wine instead of Yepo, sister?\"\\n\\n\"Yepo... You don't remember, do you?\" Her sister's eyelids close halfway. That is how her sister expresses concern — However, the ingenium forming her sister's body lacks the finesse to convey this expression, rendering it instead akin to a gesture of drowsiness.\"Yepo pursued the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and suffered fatal injuries. The Ten Lords have granted her permission for demise.\"\\n\\nShe hurriedly changed the subject.\"How was the target you pursued today? Were they difficult to deal with?\"\\n\\n\"Very difficult. He broke one of my hands and shattered my patella as soon as we met. The scoundrel seems to have knowledge over the composition of ingenia, indicating that he is indeed the skilled craftsman from the Zhuming all those years ago. I have recorded his moves. Through studies and contemplation, I will one day find a way to counter him.\"\\n\\nShe watched her sister recount that narrow escape from death with apparent indifference, as if discussing the breaking of an inanimate object. \"We will have to bother Huohuo again to repair you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Huohuo... She was promoted to judge about a dozen days ago. Currently, Shouling is in charge of maintaining the ingenia.\"\\nWith a smooth and precise motion, her sister placed the golden jug on the edge of the coffin beyond her reach. The wine within the jug sat still, without a ripple.\\n\\n\"Drink this Wine of Oblivion, and you'll forget everything. You don't have to go this far, my dear sister. I should atone for my faults through my own efforts alone.\" Just like how it is in her dream, her sister's hands were placed on her head in a gentle caress, but she cannot feel even the faintest trace of warmth.\\n\\n\"It's only a minor side effect of drinking the Wine of Oblivion. If I end up forgetting everything about you, then both of us can finally embrace our demise without any burdens. By the benevolence of the Ten Lords, this promise has been recorded in the depths of the Hall of Karma.\"\\n\\n\"And at that moment, we shall relinquish all and enter eternal slumber.\" She leans forward slightly, pressing her sister's cold hand against her cheek.\\n\\nShe takes the wine jug from the edge of the coffin and, with effort, consumes the viscous liquid sip by sip. Though called \"wine\", it lacks all pungent and invigorating flavor. Instead, it tastes like oil drained into the body of an aurumaton.\\n\\n\"But before that fateful moment, please allow me to carry out a few more tasks for you, for the Ten Lords, and for that general.\"", "4": "The wine she imbibes transforms into a dense pill of mercury, coursing through her limbs and bones. Memories she refuses to recall, fragments of her human existence from millennia past, resurface momentarily before gradually fading away...\\n\\nShe saw the crimson star known as \"Rahu\" suspended high amidst the clouds atop the Xianzhou Cangcheng, pulsating like a beating heart. Slowly, it cracked open, revealing a core composed of rocks, tendons, and branches. It voraciously consumed and gave birth to countless offspring, resembling a ravenous predator feasting or a mother on the verge of delivering.\\n\\nBeneath the nightmarish moonlight, she witnessed the Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing futilely maneuvering their starskiffs, resembling powerless flies attempting to take down an invincible behemoth, only to be crushed and reduced to flickering sparks in the air by borisin beast ships.\\n\\nA colossal, walking tree approached her amidst the chaos of the battlefield. Extending its myriad branches, it impaled all who stood in its path, including her comrades. As she gripped her fractured sword for a desperate struggle, she suddenly saw a smiling face blossoming upon the tree — a reflection of her sister's face.\\n\\n\"It's me, my dear sister. Don't you recognize me?\"\\n\\nThe branches and leaves rustled, and the faces of her companions sprouted like fruits from the treetops, emanating raucous laughter. \"Do not succumb to death. Do not grow accustomed to it. Embrace me... become a part of me...\"\\n\\nFlowers burst forth upon her sword, which then disintegrated into rust within a few heartbeats. Nimble branches gently crowned her head with a wreath. She allowed the foliage, leaves, and fragrant blooms to encircle her, just as the tender hands had embraced her...\\n\\nA colossal, blazing sword pierced through her visions, scorching away the sweet yet putrid atmosphere, almost suffocating her. A towering figure in formidable armor crashed onto the battlefield like a meteor, bellowing at the towering tree with the valor that defined his name. However, not even that valorous warrior could sever the suffocating entanglement wrought by the colossal tree...\\n\\nYes, it's that dream again, that recurring dream. No matter how many drafts of the Wine of Oblivion she consumes, she simply cannot escape the nightmare.\\n\\nShe gulps down the wine with visible effort, desperately, until the dream finally transforms into an enigmatic wisp of smoke. All that remains is the solitary thought of a restful slumber, bidding farewell to wakefulness.", "5": "On one side of the coffin, a white-robed judge fixes her gaze upon the sealed coffin. Observing her sister's slumber had been routine during her human days.\\n\\nShe can no longer feel pain or any regrets. The consciousness residing within her skull informs her that observing her sister's sleep is an arduous duty, similar to what she once did to herself.\\n\\nMaking karmic judgments and delivering sentences are profound tasks, and such responsibilities must be exclusively entrusted to judges who have detached from the mortal world yet remain attuned to the emotions of people, unlike aurumatons. While she can discern subtle shifts in the tones of human words and detect the tightening of muscles upon sorrowful countenances, none of these can stir even the faintest ripple within her heart of forged steel, and no magic can bring back her emotions as a human. That is why her sister is needed for the Ten-Lords Commission.\\n\\nAn Aurumaton Spectral Envoy approaches her. \"A new task?\" The white-robed judge turns to the envoy.\\n\\n\"If you wish to remain and attend to Madam Hanya, I can ask other judges to undertake the task instead.\"\\n\\n\"That won't be necessary. I don't wish to disappoint her. Furthermore, I've reached an agreement with the Ten Lords. For every malefactor I apprehend, I shall be granted the freedom to return to the mortal realm for half a day. She's been inside the coffin for too long, and I'd like to bestow such a chance for her to bask in the sun.\"\\n\\n\"Then, please prepare your sacred vessels and commence the exorcism, Madam.\" The aurumaton bows in deference.\\n\\nThe white-robed judge remains emotionless as she peers into the darkness. Within her heart that no longer beats, there resides a simple aspiration, that her sister will dream a tender and blissful dream...\\n\\nThat she will dream of nimble hands gently crowning her head with a wreath."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Oracle Brush", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 50% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 60% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 70% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 80% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 90% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 1% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 110% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 120% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 130% of Hanya's ATK to a single enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Physical DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Samsara, Locked", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Physical DMG equal to 120% of Hanya's ATK to a single target enemy, then applies Burden to them.\\nFor every 2 Basic ATKs, Skills, or Ultimates allies use on an enemy with Burden, allies will immediately recover 1 Skill Point.

I'm so sorry.\"\\n\"You don't need to apologize, kind-hearted girl. However, you'll be under our custody from now onwards.\"\\n\"Th—Thank you, Madam.\"\\n\"Call me Hanya.\"\\n\"Ah, thank you, Madam Hanya. I... my name is Huohuo.\"\\n\\nThe thoughts of the judge named Hanya wanders back to a few days ago.\\n\\nThe Ten-Lords Commission received a distress call, and she took on the task of locating the Foxian girl who was about to be consumed by a heliobus. At the moment, Hanya couldn't repel the heliobus by force without causing harm to Huohuo, who was still a little girl. As a result, she had to seal the heliobus onto the girl's tail. Fortunately, the heliobus decided to start the possession from her tail, giving Hanya a chance to save her life.\\n\\n\"...Was my decision right or wrong?\"\\nHanya mutters to herself.", "3": "While the heliobus is short-tempered and arrogant, he is not impossible to communicate with. He could not tolerate Huohuo's sobbing and wailing and didn't quite understand how Foxians socialize — for example, he didn't understand why the girl would be ostracized by her classmates due to \"her tail being on fire.\"\\n\\n\"You! Tear off that talisman!\"\\n\"No! Madam Hanya said the talisman must not be removed under any circumstances...\"\\n\"Did you hear them? How dare they mock me!? I've never been humiliated like this before!\"\\n\"No... they're not mocking you... but me...\"\\n\"Then you go teach them a lesson yourself. If you can't avenge me for this insult, then don't talk to me anymore.\"\\n\"B—But... I'm scared...\"\\n\"Alright, fine. You know what? Just take a deep breath, make your mind go blank, and don't think about anything. I'll handle this problem for you.\"\\n\"B—But... Madam Hanya said... the talisman must not be removed...\"\\n\"Don't worry. Just do what I say.\"\\n\\n...When she regained consciousness, the legend of \"the possessed demoness\" was already circulating.\\n\\nAfter that, Huohuo went and found out a lot about the heliobus' past. Eons ago, a heliobus named Ignamar was defeated by a Luofu general and fragmented into numerous shards, then sealed in the Creation Furnace. This particular shard escaped, and he represents the arrogant side of Ignamar and wouldn't condescend to possessing anything, living as a vagabond for centuries... until Huohuo chanced upon him in his utter exhaustion.\\n\\n\"Then I'll call you 'Tail' to avoid unwanted attention...\"\\nThe heliobus said nothing, his silence being a sign of acquiescence.", "4": "When Huohuo was taken in by the Ten-Lords Commission, the judges initially wanted to ensure that Tail wouldn't cause any trouble.\\n\\nGradually, as she familiarized herself with her duties as a spiritfarer, she became acquainted with the various evil spirits documented by the Commission.\\n\\n\"Madam Xueyi! H—How about the talismans I prepared last time?\"\\n\"They were great. Very effective against Astral Spirits.\"\\n\"Ha—Haha... Glad to know that. I was worried if it would work well.\"\\n\"Why didn't you try them yourself?\"\\n\"N—N—No... I'm too scared...\"\\n\"You know, Huohuo? Most of those 'evil spirits' are actually extraterrestrial creatures or malevolent sentient beings that exist in various forms.\"\\n\"I know what they are, but I'm still so afraid, Madam Xueyi. Maybe I'm not really cut out for this job...\"\\n\"...Well, only you know the answer to that.\"\\n\\nHuohuo is not okay with her timidity. She struggled to muster the courage needed to confront the evil spirits.\\n\\nShe stayed up late watching horror-comedy films in an attempt to strengthen her nerves, but all she got were dark circles. She invested in the latest scientific exorcism tools to enhance her abilities, but it only left her with empty pockets. Tail sneered at the futility of her efforts, finding ways to make sarcastic remarks and mock her.\\n\\n\"To be honest, Tail is the scariest of all...\"\\nHowever, in Xueyi's eyes, Huohuo has long ceased to fear Tail.", "5": "Initially, Tail was no different from any other heliobi, intending to devour Huohuo and take possession of her name and identity, stealing all of her desires and emotions.\\n\\nLater, Tail found pleasure in witnessing Huohuo's frustrations in her failures. \"Anyway, I'm not in a hurry to devour her at all. She can't escape me after all.\"\\n\\n\"Tail, Tail! Help... Help me!\"\\n\"It's none of my concern. What did you say back then...? Oh, you've got to 'stand on your own feet.' Now this is the perfect chance, isn't it?\"\\n\"No! I'll stand on my feet next time! Please help me!\"\\n\"A reminder, once you die, I'll be free. But... well, I always finish what I start. I won't leave until I devour you.\"\\n\"You're a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, but you've neglected your duty and allowed those monsters to wreak havoc on the Xianzhou. What a disgrace... Hey! What do you think you're doing, small fry!? I'm the only one who can scold her!\"\\n\"Roaaaarr!\"\\n\"You want to get physical, huh? Good, you asked for it!\"\\n\\nSince being possessed by Tail, Huohuo has become highly sought-after by evil spirits, like moths to a flame.\\n\\nHuohuo always blames Tail for her ominous title as the \"cursed one,\" and Tail finds having a host like Huohuo can be frustrating at times. However, years have passed, and Tail hasn't harmed Huohuo in the slightest. Although Tail never fails to help her after witnessing enough frustration, he denies any notion of friendship.\\n\\n\"Issued by the Ten Lords, Huohuo the spiritfarer has performed extraordinarily during her tenure and has proven to be reliable for crucial tasks. She is hereby promoted to the position of 'Judge.'\"\\nThe Ten-Lords Commission decreed her promotion, and thus begun Huohuo's new tenure as a trainee judge."}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Banner: Stormcaller", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 25% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 30% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 35% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 40% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 45% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 50% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 55% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 60% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Wind DMG equal to 65% of Huohuo's Max HP to a target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Wind DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Talisman: Protection", "SkillTag": "Restore", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Dispels 1 debuff(s) from a single target ally and immediately restores this ally's HP by an amount equal to 14% of Huohuo's Max HP plus 140.

Amidst the chaos, he sought refuge underground and, by chance, discovered an ocarina beneath a stone tile.\\nWith trembling hands, he attempted to coax a melody from the instrument.\\nHowever, his \"music\" proved to be terrible.\\n\\nYet, the ethereal notes emanating from his ocarina became his sanctuary, a spiritual escape from the harsh reality.\\n\\nOver time, the melodic strains faded into the recesses of his memory, becoming a mysterious and elusive moment. It was only years later, during a bard tour, when he saved a child from the flames of war and received a precious ocarina as a token of gratitude, that the melodies of his past resurfaced.\\nHolding the exquisite instrument in his hands, he examined its flawless and noble craftsmanship. Once again, the melodies of his childhood converged, evoking a flood of emotions and memories.\\nHowever, his \"music\" remained terrible.\\n\\n\"I'm too clumsy to master this instrument...\"\\nHe murmured in self-deprecation. Yet, after a profound moment of contemplation, a resolute courage ignited within him. He resolved to try once more, to weave a melody.\\nThe music remained unchanged, but this time, he laughed wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\"Despite the terrible music, I love it. I believe it to be beautiful.\"\\nCarefully stowing away his ocarina, he once again embarked on his journey without hesitation.", "3": "After leaving his hometown, he became the apprentice of an elderly master.\\nAlongside physical and mental training, he would often listen to his master's tales of bygone eras — stories of transcendent beauty and mystical phenomena witnessed by the Minstrels.\\n\\n\"It was a world bathed in amber, draped in undisturbed stillness, where every being shed tears for the magnificent wonders veiled beneath its surface.\"\\n\"Rumor has it that Idrila, after embarking on a journey spanning numerous cycles of Thirteen Amber Eras, will make a triumphant return to the universe during the elusive thirteenth month.\"\\n\\nDay after day, his master imparted the essence of beauty to him.

He contemplated his existence, pondering the nature of his being. Instead of lamenting his solitude, he focused on becoming a true knight.\\n\\nDuring his stay in an old city, he labored to restore its dilapidated streets.\\nHe vanquished nightmarish monsters, and with the arrival of spring, rabbits frolicked once again in the woods.\\nHe also briefly found companionship in the presence of another knight, who professed his faith in the blessings of the goddess residing within his armor.\\n\\n\"To give one's soul requires understanding that each encounter might be one's last, yet retreating is never an option.\"\\n\"Carry these words of courage with you, my dear friend.\"\\n\\nHe contemplated on his lance, which bore the stains of countless battles fought in the name of Beauty.\\nWith solemn reverence, he wiped away each mark, a testament to his tireless odyssey toward the pursuit of Beauty.", "4": "Since embarking on the Path of Beauty, a path of asceticism, he had faced numerous trials.

With each victory, his weaknesses, greed, and distractions dissolved into oblivion. He pledged to offer his soul and life at the feet of the Aeon of Beauty.\\n\\nThe profane words of the Triple Demons resembled fragmented ravings, morphing into manifestations of human desires.\\nThey embodied the crass pursuit of personal gain, shameless indulgence in sin, the allure of power, and the enticement of battle and worldly pleasures.\\nTheir aim was to erode repentance and replace it with the banality of common sense.\\n\\nHis blood mingled with his flowing locks on the battlefield, with each crimson droplet intertwined with honor. His lance stood resolute at his side, blessed by the divine to retain its everlasting sharpness.\\nThe echoes of his esteemed master and comrades transformed into whispers. His spear would never yield, even if his master had succumbed to evil temptations.\\n\\nDrenched in blood, teetering on the precipice of consciousness, he finally discerned a faint murmur that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of existence.\\n\\n\"You defy infamy.

The Knights of Beauty are a bunch of freaks!\"\\n\\nAs rumors of Idrila's demise spread throughout the cosmos, their perplexity deepened.\\nPiety intermingled with doubt, and laughter intertwined with lunacy.\\nNotions of honor, reputation, and infamy dissolved into nothingness.\\n\\nThis marked the end of everything.\\n\\nWhen he finally encountered his former comrade, he found a knight who had become a fanatic, lost in a blind pursuit of power.\\nThe former hero who had wielded a legendary weapon and vanquished the sky devourer had degenerated into a beast. His armor transformed into the scaly hide of the behemoth he had slain, his weapon into unyielding claws and fangs, and his blood into a viscous and restless flame. His eyes, once filled with wisdom, now burned with untamed wildness. The voice that had once addressed him as \"my dear friend\" had dwindled to a hissing cry.\\n\\nThe words spoken during the trial carried the weight of the Finality's impending prophecy, signaling the

Her insignificant anticipation always gave her mother's research an inviting smell.\\n\\nStarting from their home, a planet blessed by Abundance, they boarded research aircraft and set off to more worlds.\\nSurrounded by flash bombs, silk headscarves, ribbons, and embroidery, the girl embraced joy amongst \"lifeforms\" created by spiraling and ascending data.\\n\\n\"A-Ruan, after eating Qingtuan, you must wash your fingers thoroughly before you can touch the lab bench.\"", "3": "She was dressed all in black in a mourning attire at her parents' funeral.

In Ratio's homeworld, there are no less than eight documentaries detailing his legendary exploits, and over a dozen memoirs about him. However, despite the plethora of commentaries, none of them seems to provide a compelling perspective. To fill this void, I personally visited Professor Rond, who had a significant influence on Ratio's upbringing. Though advanced in years and unable to speak coherently, Professor Rond couldn't contain his excitement at the mention of Ratio's name. With the help of his family and students, I obtained a yellowed yet remarkably well-preserved letter of recommendation.\\n\\n\\n\"To the respected admission committee of the University of Veritas Prime:\\n\\nI am Rond, Professor Emeritus of the Department of Mathematics at the Cosmos Liberty University. Given your institution's reputation for valuing talents and education, I would like to recommend a student named Ratio to advance his studies at your university. Although Ratio is a middle school student at the moment, his mastery of math, physics, and even philosophy has far exceeded the requirements for an undergraduate degree in many universities.\\n\\nWhile he was under my tutelage, Ratio managed to solve complicated mathematical equations at an unexpectedly staggering speed. The undergraduates in my class struggled to even comprehend the concepts. Out of curiosity, I shared a manuscript about an equation named Rond's Conjecture in private. Although I'm the one who proposed the equation, I've been unable to prove it. After days of discussion, Ratio came up with a brilliant and stunning idea that managed to finally prove the equation in one strike. The paper will be published shortly, and you will see that I am speaking the truth.\\n\\nRatio showed remarkable perception, curiosity, and creativity during the time we spent together. He wakes up early every morning to exercise before diving straight into the sea of knowledge afterward. Perhaps, he is exactly what everyone would picture a genius to be — passionate, profound, fervent, and inherently dominating.\\n\\nDue to the lack of more advanced science programs at local schools, I sincerely hope that your esteemed institution will accept Ratio's enrollment. I can vouch for him on my reputation that he will definitely achieve accomplishments that transcend this era and bring glory to your widely-renowned institution.\\n\\nBest wishes,\\nRond\\n██ ██ ██, Philosopher Calendar\"\\n\\nExtracted from page 9, Wisdom as a Privilege: Decoding Dr. Ratio", "3": "After acquiring his eighth doctoral degree, Ratio was awarded the First Class Honors Degree that had been left vacant for two Amber Eras in the University of Veritas Prime.

No matter how amazing Ratio's accomplishments are in the eyes of the ordinary folks, Nous has never batted an eye at him. This issue has become a much-discussed mystery in the academic community over time. I reached out to Margaret, a former assistant of Ratio, and gathered some valuable testimony from her.\\n\\n\"Mr. Ratio has never talked about the Genius Society with me, but there's something I remember well, even till today... It happened when I was still Mr. Ratio's academic assistant. I'm mainly responsible for managing his correspondences to and from all over the cosmos and handling his interactions with the outside world.\"\\n\\n\"One day, I received a letter from Interastral Peace Corporation. I think... it was during the successful test-firing of the anti-planetary weapon Mr. Ratio had worked on for years. I could tell the solemnity of the invitation, so I excitedly passed it on to Mr. Ratio. Yet, he said nothing. I could sense his heavy silence even through the headgear. He then politely asked me to leave. The moment I closed the door, I heard a grim sigh followed by a self-deprecating laughter... Perhaps, he realized he would never be accepted into the Genius Society...\"\\n\\n\"The rest is history. In my view, Mr. Ratio is a genius in the truest sense of the word, as his inventions have propelled many worlds forward. Is a scholar who heals the universe destined to be worthless than a genius who is confined to their own ivory tower? Sorry, I'm getting a little worked up. Please remove that statement.\"\\n\\nFrom my observation, many of Dr. Ratio's supporters feel sorry for him like Margaret. In their opinion, the Society's failure to admit someone like Ratio is a manifestation of the eccentricity and narrow-mindedness of \"geniuses.\"\\n\\nExtracted from page 150, Wisdom as a Privilege: Decoding Dr. Ratio", "5": "Many believe that after joining the Intelligentsia Guild, Ratio will learn to smooth out his sharp personality to adapt to the Guild's practical and simplistic academic environment. But I must say Ratio is still his old self. Below is the original excerpt from the internal records that I have transcribed:\\n\\n\"\\nRespondent: Veritas Ratio\\nSubject: Logical Epistemology\\nChairman of the Committee: Roseth\\nTranscriber: Morriway\\nDefense Transcript:\\nRoseth: Mr. Ratio, your paper is exceptional. Thank you for your presentation. Now, we will open the floor for questions.\\nThere was a silence.\\nRoseth: Well, I'll do the honor then.\\nRoseth: I fully concur with your main ideas, but there's a detail that I find slightly confusing.\\nVeritas Ratio: Whenever someone agrees with me, I feel like I must be wrong.\\nRoseth: My question is, why do you think knowledge is a privilege?\\nVeritas Ratio: Dear Professor Roseth, your question indicates that you haven't fully grasped the content of my paper and do not understand the deductive methods I employed.\\nVeritas Ratio: To put it simply, you would be a great example. Your inability to comprehend my ideas shows precisely that knowledge is not for everyone.\\nVeritas Ratio: If ignorance is an ailment, it is the duty of scholars to weed it out and heal the universe.\\nVeritas Ratio walked to the podium, facing the crowd. Veritas Ratio: So, ladies and gentlemen, turning a blind eye to the folly of others is not an etiquette, but a wicked worldly practice. To spread knowledge, we must first make people realize their folly. The same surely applies to the scholars of the Guild.\\nRoseth shrugged and smiled bitterly.\\n...\\nVeritas Ratio left amid the commotion.\\nRemark: A passionate hand holding an icy sword — that is probably the best way to describe Mr. Veritas Ratio. By blending logic, passion, and the art of criticism into one, Ratio presents to us how a great thinker perceives and reacts to ignorance. We strongly believe that the addition of Mr. Veritas Ratio will bring immeasurable benefits to the Intelligentsia Guild.\\nCommittee Decision: Approved unanimously.\\n\"\\n\\nThere are words about a mysterious organization within the Intelligentsia Guild called the \"Council of Mundanites\" that houses the brightest minds of the Guild. The fact that Ratio calls himself a Mundanite seems to affirm the rumor. It is hard not to read something into the organization's name, given Ratio's entangled history with the Genius Society. The mundane, as opposed to the ingenious, often has to make enormous efforts and sacrifices just to catch up with the latter. Is Ratio calling himself mundane a form of submission, mockery, or declaration of war? Anyway, he does live up to his name of Dr. Ratio with his dedication to curing ill minds with knowledge.\\n...\\n\\nExtracted from page 230, Wisdom as a Privilege: Decoding Dr. Ratio"}, "skill": [{"SkillName": "Mind is Might", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Basic ATK", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 50% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 60% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 70% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 80% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 90% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 1% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 110% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 120% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 130% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals minor Imaginary DMG to a single target enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Intellectual Midwifery", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Skill", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 75% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"2": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 82% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"3": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 90% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"4": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 98% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"5": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 105% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"6": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 112% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"7": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 122% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"8": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 131% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"9": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 141% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"10": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 150% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"11": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 158% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"12": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 165% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"13": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 172% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"14": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 180% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}, {"15": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 188% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy.", "SimpleSkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG to a single enemy."}}]}, {"SkillName": "Syllogistic Paradox", "SkillTag": "Single Target", "SkillTypeDesc": "Ultimate", "levels": [{"1": {"SkillDesc": "Deals Imaginary DMG equal to 144% of Dr. Ratio's ATK to a single target enemy and applies Wiseman's Folly.

The only thing that can get her attention is \"amusement.\"", "2": "The girl, an abandoned orphan, lived without knowledge of her origins or destination until she encountered a passing troupe. From a distance, she watched a black-haired lady with a double ponytail, gracefully moving across the stage like a fish. Despite donning various masks, they did not hinder her laughs and cries during her performance, captivating the audience even from afar. The fish leaped in front of her, then dove back down, creating ripples in the surface of the water.\\n\\nGradually, she realized she was watching the performance from beneath the stage.\\n\\nIntrigued, she continued to watch the performances for countless days, but she remained an audience member, never stepping into the spotlight. After one of the shows ended, she went backstage, where the black-haired lady handed her a mask.\\n\"Can I perform, too?\"\\n\"Why not? If others believe you are 'Sparkle,' then you are. Go, it's time for your show.\"\\n\\nAs the curtain, serving as the fourth wall, was drawn, the stage remained dimly lit, revealing an unsettling black void. Though wearing a mask, she knew the audience could see and hear her. She kept recalling Sparkle's performance, imitating her movements, voice, and demeanor.\\n\\n\"You've done very well for your first time.\"\\n\"But my imitation... Was not perfect.\"\\n\"That is a minor hiccup, but not a problem as long as nobody notices the difference... By the way, we are leaving tomorrow, so for as long as you want, you are the true Sparkle here, and you can make her whoever you want her to be.\"\\nSparkle wanted to say something, but the lady affectionately rubbed her head.\\n\"Not many people come to see us, except for you. We're just a small troupe, and we don't have grand aspirations of becoming famous in the cosmos... It brings me joy to meet someone like you who will remember an insignificant character named Sparkle... Don't cry, you can keep this mask. Now it's yours.\"\\nSparkle nodded.\\n\"When you don this mask, you have the power to become anyone and no one... If you truly aspire to be an actor, don't limit yourself to this small stage. Set your sights on the larger world and explore new horizons.\"", "3": "As the last descendant of the Puppet Clan, the girl lacked the freedom to choose. She was bound to live her life according to the dictates of the mask, as puppets were mere vessels for the masks.\\n\\nAccording to their legend, the longer a puppet dons a mask, the higher the chances of the puppet acquiring a soul, resembling a true human. However, in human folklore, masks were depicted as tools used for resurrecting the deceased, thus leading to the dwindling numbers of her people.\\n\\nHowever, as she had no interest in becoming human, being a doll was not an unfavorable choice for her. She dutifully obeyed the commands of the mask, despite the risk of attracting pursuers, as defying the mask proved to be challenging.\\n\\nMovement was a crucial aspect.\\nBy the will of the mask, she needed to smile sweetly when happy, hold her forehead while crying, grit her teeth when angry, narrow her eyes when jealous, and make a scene when in despair. There were also signature gestures, such as raising her eyebrows slightly to face others with the left side of her face, and raising her hand to express love, although she had to lower it later, as slightly biting her lower lip was the way to convey her true desires.\\n\\nVoice was another aspect.\\nDepending on the situation, her voice needed to be cheerful when happy, mellifluous when expressing lyrical emotions, calm and assertive when making statements, strained when harboring hatred, and sorrowful when filled with grief.\\n\\nRemarkably, she managed to sustain this way of life for years, seamlessly blending into her surroundings and even becoming a playwright. Nobody ever suspected that she wore a mask. However, she couldn't help but wonder if there existed another type of \"mask\" in the world — perhaps someone wearing such a mask would laugh when seeking revenge, shed tears when smiling, remain silent when raging... And speak the most sarcastic remarks with the utmost calmness.\\n\\nNaturally, she couldn't do this due to the will of the mask, but as a playwright, making her characters on stage act like this was easy for her.\\n\\nOne morning, the doorbell rang, but it wasn't her usual delivery person at the door.\\n\"Dear Miss Sparkle, I wonder if we could have a chat?\"\\n\"We have read your latest work, and we're curious if you know anything about the 'Mask'...\"\\n", "4": "The faceless girl realized that she must be under some kind of curse. Why else couldn't she feel any stimuli? Her sense of pain, taste, and smell were all intact, yet she was unable to react to them. Naturally, she couldn't experience joy, anger, sadness, or a range of emotions. She could only strive to observe others' reactions in various situations to understand their feelings.\\n\\n\"...How would you feel if you were drinking a cup of bitter tea? How would you drink it?\"\\nAlthough tied to the chair and immobilized, the homeless man on the left made an appreciative gesture and nodded. The girl in the middle immediately cried and shook her head in denial, while the madam on the right wrinkled her nose in disgust.\\n\\n\"What if you were in an extremely cold hut, with only this cup of tea at hand?\"\\nNaturally, the man nodded. The girl cried for a while and then reluctantly accepted, while the lady still reacted in disgust.\\n\\nShe continued to change her scenarios and ask questions day and night until her interviewees passed out. She would send them home and seek out new targets for her \"interviews.\"\\n\\nDuring that time, the town's inhabitants all had the same nightmare. They found themselves trapped in a place where a blurred-faced young girl politely asked them questions, and they had no choice but to answer. They could only provide responses repeatedly until the young girl meticulously recorded every detail on paper masks, one after another. Whenever a mask was filled, it was replaced by another.\\n\\nThis nightmare was soon replaced by another, as residents claimed to see paper masks flying through the air in the middle of the night. The masks would talk to each other, faintly glowing before eventually fading out, resembling sparklers in the night sky. They appeared every night, as if they were residents living in the shadow of the town.\\n\\nIn a dark basement, a young lady remained unaware of this nightmare. She had gathered enough information about people's nuanced emotions and their perceptions of different things... To make more paper masks. She firmly believed that although she possessed no emotions, the masks she created had flesh and blood. She even believed that one day, they would become real beings.", "5": "\"There are a few versions that are particularly popular.\" When Sparkle arrived at Fool's Tavern, she admitted her deeds. \"Liking and believing are two different things, but people are more likely to believe in their favorite stories.\"\\n\\n\"Lies? Come on, I'm not trying to tell a grand story or fabricate an eye-catching experience... I'm wholeheartedly exercising my imagination for my own sake. I imagine various lives, seek excitement, and then recreate them as best I can, and pump the brakes on my imaginative balloon just a second before it bursts.\"\\n\\n\"Seriously, having a script is far from enough. First and foremost, I must wholeheartedly believe that the character I'm portraying truly exists. Then, I need to imagine the other stories where the character would appear.

After all, I might encounter other Fools, and I won't know what they want until I know who they are. Sometimes, you simply like the appearance of a character, and sometimes, you just want to experience it for fun. I do that sometimes, too.\"\\n\\n\"And of course, there are those who play solely for the sake of gain or to be regarded in that way, hoping for unimaginable wealth, status, or power... Anyway, what I'm trying to convey is that in such an environment, who but myself can guarantee that I won't stray from my intended path and become a character in someone else's story? Nobody! That's why I have to tirelessly imagine and immerse myself in the act.\"\\n\\n\"No, I'm not denying it... It's truly addictive to me. The more I imagine, the more I get absorbed in those characters, the wonderful and tragic situations I create for them, and the emotions they experience in those circumstances...\"\\n\\n\"Sure, I used to think about that kind of life...

The scent of motor oil, leather, and tobacco greeted him as several tall figures entered the threshold.\\n\\n\"W—Welcome...\"\\n\\nThe adventurers, who had journeyed from distant planets, paid little attention to the small figure welcoming them at the door, engrossed in their animated tales of peculiar encounters. These stories never failed to stir Misha's emotions, attracting his attention.\\n\\n\"Have you seen a massive beam coming down from the sky and burn through a lush planet?... I was actually right there, and our ship got blasted away by the insane gust of wind... I risked my life to snap some photos...\"\\n\"Hah, let me tell you, that's nothing compared to the crazy stuff I've experienced. Once, I ventured into this abyss in the Memory Zone. It was like a total nightmare, with all these unimaginable monsters and even ghosts lurking around...\"\\n\"You think that's scary? Try witnessing the Swarm that completely blots out the entire sky! I barely made it out alive from that hellish encounter. And guess what? The whole dang planet got wiped out...\"\\n\\nEnviously listening to these tales, whether genuine or fabricated, Misha mustered the courage to speak up.\\n\"Um... Excuse me, but if I want to venture into the galaxy, what should I learn?\"\\nThe conversation came to a halt, and several explorers turned their gaze towards him.\\n\"What did you say, kiddo? You want to explore the galaxy?\"\\n\"Yeah... I wish I could become an adventurer... Just like my grandpa.\"\\n\"That's quite an ambition! Hahaha!\"\\n\"Hey, kiddo, this line of work is no joke. You'll need to learn how to handle weapons, fix things on the fly, and navigate through all sorts of obstacles. It requires a wealth of knowledge!\"\\n\"I understand... Grandpa's always complaining about getting lost and machines breaking down. Maybe I can start by addressing those issues...\"\\n\"Hey, just stop scaring that little one.\"\\nThe elderly man at the forefront cleared his throat and turned his attention to Misha.\\n\"You can learn everything you need, but you really need to think if this is truly what you desire. Are you truly eager to achieve it? And how long are you willing to stick with it? Those are the most crucial questions, little one.\"", "3": "As the pocket watch struck two o'clock in the afternoon, signaling the end of his duties, he changed his overalls and started the task of overhauling the machinery.\\n\\nWalder led the way, occasionally pausing to tap on intricate mechanisms. Misha followed closely behind, attuned to the noises emanating from the machinery and adeptly locating the issues.\\n\\nToday's assignment involved repairing a multitude of broken clocks, rusty, discarded, missing gears, or shattered. To Misha, they appeared as lost sailors desperately in need of guidance.\\n\\n\"Please head west, Mr. Wall Clock... And hey, Mrs. Pocket Watch! Please don't stop there!\"\\n\"Mr. Alarm Clock, please have a meal before resuming, and you three ladies over there, please follow Mr. Pocket Watch!\"\\nAt that moment, all the malfunctioning clocks sprang to life.

We're about to reach our destination.\"\\n\"Let's keep sailing! The sea won't hinder us!\"\\nIn Misha's eyes, the clocks seemed to possess lives of their own, expressing their delight in moving forward.\\n\\nWalder smiled and patted his head.\\n\"Looks like I won't have to worry about time here. After all, you are the captain of these clocks.\"", "4": "As the pocket watch struck seven o'clock in the evening, Misha finished his supper and settled onto the cot that had been modified from a cupboard.\\nGazing into the darkness surrounding him, he listened to the ceaseless ticking of the pocket watch — the most blissful hours of his day. No work, no reality, only unrestricted flights of fantasy.\\n\\nAfter traveling through the fog, his fantasy story reached the most exciting part of the sea battle. He extended his hands, pulling back his companions who had been knocked over by the waves, and he drew another line across the canvas as if vanquishing a sea monster...\\n\\n\"Captain, Captain, wake up, it's clearing up!\"\\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked incredulously at the sight before him.\\nA golden pocket watch, which had transformed into a figure with arms and legs, dressed in a uniform and a red bow tie, beckoned him over.\\nA silver mirror lady reflected him, adjusting her gown and peering through binoculars at the distant scene.\\nThe storm from the previous night had disappeared without a trace. A refreshing sea breeze fluttered Misha's uniform, and in the distance, they could see the outline of the New World.\\n\\n\"Look, Captain, the coast is not far off!\"\\nTaking Misha's hand, Mr. Pocket Watch and Miss Mirror gracefully leaped onto the clouds. Before he could react, the three of them were airborne, gazing at the boundless sea and the crescent-shaped continent below them. Mr. Pocket Watch and Miss Mirror cheered, pulling Misha into a joyful tap dance. He held his companions' hands tightly, his heart filled with amazement and joy.\\n\\n\"Are... Are you my companions?\"\\n\"Yeah, we've faced countless challenges and gotten lost many times along the way, but we've finally found the New World!\"\\n...\\n\\nAt dawn, Misha woke up from his dream, a tear rolled down from the corner of his eye.\\nLooking around his bedroom, he noticed the pocket watch pressed against his chest, and the mirror had fallen off the wall.\\nWiping away the tears, Misha felt as if he had lost nothing, yet he had lost everything.", "5": "As the pocket watch struck six o'clock again in the morning, the familiar aroma of milk and toast wafted into his narrow bedroom from the kitchen as usual.\\n\\nHe had settled into this life, burying his dreams deep within his heart. He was no longer easily captivated by the stories of the guests, nor did he hold onto the hope of his grandfather's immediate return.\\n\\n\"Maybe that's how adults are. They don't keep their promises, and they don't really want to listen to children.\"\\nHe took the guests' suitcases and bags. The guests walked away without a second glance, leaving him alone and muttering to himself.\\n\\nHe went back to his room of clocks and checked the various clocks displaying different times from different time zones as usual. He stared blankly at the wall full of clocks, imagining the stories and worlds that existed within them. Lost in thoughts of these fantastical realms, he unfolded a drawing paper and began sketching the adventures he experienced with his imaginary companions.\\n\\nThat was the end of the story.\\n\\n\"Farewell, my companions! I'll stay in the New World, and once it's fully built, I'll continue traveling with you to other new worlds!\"\\n\"Farewell, Captain Misha! May our paths cross again!\"\\nAll his companions left except his ever-excited first mate, Mr. Pocket Watch, and the gentle Miss Mirror.
